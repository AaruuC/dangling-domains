No new logins needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate as needed\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical concerns are escalated immediately to Penn Medicine OnDemand nurses, physicians and APPs via PennChart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Eligibility Criteria\nPenn Medicine Guidelines\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n COVID Watch\nFAQs for Providers\n\n\n\n\nWhy should I refer my patients to COVID Watch?\nWith daily monitoring, COVID Watch can help quickly identify and facilitate escalations of patients with symptoms concerning for hypoxemia and/or severe pulmonary distress, while reducing ED volume of less concerning patients with mild symptoms who do not require hospitalization.\n\n\n\nWho should I refer to COVID Watch?\nPatients have tested COVID-19 positive (symptomatic or asymptomatic), are COVID-pending, or have significant respiratory symptoms concerning for COVID-19. In general, providers can refer to COVID Watch at the time when a test is ordered. Given the current low sensitivity of COVID testing, a negative test does not necessarily indicate true negative status.\n\n\n\nIs this suitable for patients who need in-person evaluations?\nCOVID Watch is currently only available for home-dwelling patients with cell phones that can send and receive texts. If a patient is unable to text, needs home health care, or requires of pulse oximetry due to advanced lung or cardiac disease, they should be referred to Penn Medicine Home Health (via PennChart). Home care can evaluate the patient within 24-36 hrs, get vital signs, leave home monitoring equipment (e.g. pulse ox), and can follow-up with a more intensive home monitoring program.\n\n\n\nWho responds to patient escalations?\nIf a patient reports that their breathing has become difficult through COVID Watch, an escalation notice is sent to a dedicated group of nurses within PennChart. The RN will call and triage patients within an hour of the escalation and refer them directly to an ED, for urgent follow-up with an appointment with Penn Medicine on Demand, or to their PCP for non-urgent follow-up. Patients without a usual source of care will be referred to Penn Medicine on Demand.  The RNs are backed up by an on call APP and MD for any urgent issues, day or night.\n\n\nEscalation Pathway\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Are you a Penn Medicine provider?\nView enrollment instructions here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Current Covid Watch Enrollments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Patients can only be enrolled into this program by a Penn Medicine provider.\nBy participating in this program, your information and responses may be used for research purposes to evaluate the COVID\n          Watch program and assess outcomes for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.

By investigating ideas under three distinct lenses, drawing during the course of the year from the humanities, social sciences and sciences, students sharpen their focus on the similarities—and differences—between the disciplines’ habits of mind.\nFor a glimpse at ISP's origins, see: Link \nAnd a longer version of President Gutmann's Introduction to the program: Link\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s New\n\n\n\n\n  \n Congratulations to Andrew Sontag on being named a Goldwater Scholar! \n April 11 \n Andrew Sontag is on of 5 Penn Juniors awarded a Goldwater Scholar.  See the CURF webpage for more detailed information.  Congratulati \n\n Several ISP Alumni named to Phi Beta Kappa 2022 \n April 11 \n Congratulations to ISP alumni recently inducted into Phi Beta Kappa!  Well done all!\n1.     Julia Davies\n  \n\n Congratulations to Professor Bowes, Director of ISP on her Guggenheim Fellowship! \n April 11 \n Dr. \n\n Congratulations to our newest ISP Alumnae inducted into Phi Beta Kappa! \n April 19 \n Congratulations to our newest ISP alumae, Phi Beta Kappa inductees: Kira Horowitz, Christina Recto, Rachel Steinig, and Elsa Wefes-Potter!\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmeet some isp students and alumni\n\n\n \n  \n Nicky  Belgrad \n\n I am a sophomore in the College of Arts & Sciences, majoring in philosophy and minoring in cinema and media studies.

For example, generating a protein involves translation and folding; generating an organism involves a cascade of gene regulatory and cell biological processes. We are interested in such bio-generative processes and understanding the temporal control, architecture, and evolution of these processes. \r\n\n \nSince 2007,  Jim Eberwine (Pharm)  and I have been engaged in multiple joint projects concerning genomics of cell differentiation and cell diversity. Our labs collaborate in all kinds of projects where we bounce ideas off each other, design and carryout experiments together, and design analysis of data together. Many of the projects described below, especially in neuroscience are joint projects between our two labs.\r\n \nIn addition , we work on a wide range of collaborative projects and computational biology projects. Currently, these collaborations involve molecular control of neurons, functional prediction of sequence elements for genes involved in synaptic transmission, novel technologies for functional genomics, statistical analysis of whole-genome expression profiling, as well as software engineering bioinformatics analysis platforms. We employ a variety of techniques including discrete algorithms,simulations, statistical learning, dynamical systems and algebraic geometry, molecular biology, functional genomics, and single-cell genomics.  \r\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Areas\n\n Comparative Genomics of Mammalian Neurons\n Single Cell Genomics\n Evolution of Gene Regulation and Developmental Systems\n Computational Infrastructure for Deducing the Tree of Life\n Comparative Genomics and Molecular Evolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJK's Essays: Ground Strokes\n\n\n\n\"Those who like to talk about intelligence are like acorns who brag about their height; there are big ones and there are small ones but they are still acorns\"  -- Old Korean Story\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2015 J.

New technologies and philosophies of vision influence how we see ourselves and our world, and how we think about seeing itself. \nWhat do art and design look like when they are informed by understanding of the neurobiology of vision? How can theories and philosophies of vision enrich design, architecture, and communications? What if research into visual perception were shaped by the histories and cultures of seeing? These are just a few of the challenges taken up by the University of Pennslvania's Visual Studies majors as they remake design, vision science, philosophy, and art history for the 21st century. Fundamentally interdisciplinary, the Visual Studies Program partners with the Departments of Philosophy, Psychology, History of Art, Fine Arts, and Architecture. \nThe Visual Studies Major was created in 2003 to allow students to directly engage these developments through a multi-disciplinary course of study, connecting the theory, practice, and culture of seeing.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssociate Director: Dr. Ian Verstegen\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n3405 Woodland Walk\n105 Jaffe History of Art Building\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104-6125\nPhone: 215.746.2066\nverstege@sas.upenn.edu\n \nDirector: Professor Gary Hatfield422 Claudia Cohen HallOffice hours: T 1-2pm, R 12-1pm, and by appointment.hatfield@sas.upenn.edu\n \nFollow us\n\nfacebook\nyoutube\nflickr\n\nSign up for our mailing list ›\n\n\n \n\nPenn WebLogin\n \n\n\n© 2023 The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\n\n \n\n",

You should replace this file (located at\n                /var/www/html/index.html) before continuing to operate your HTTP server.\n          \n\n                If you are a normal user of this web site and don't know what this page is\n                about, this probably means that the site is currently unavailable due to\n                maintenance.\n                If the problem persists, please contact the site's administrator.\n          \n\n\n\n                Configuration Overview\n        \n\n\n                Ubuntu's Apache2 default configuration is different from the\n                upstream default configuration, and split into several files optimized for\n                interaction with Ubuntu tools. The configuration system is\n                fully documented in\n                /usr/share/doc/apache2/README.Debian.gz. Refer to this for the full\n                documentation. Documentation for the web server itself can be\n                found by accessing the manual if the apache2-doc\n                package was installed on this server.\n\n          \n\n                The configuration layout for an Apache2 web server installation on Ubuntu systems is as follows:\n          \n\n/etc/apache2/\n|-- apache2.conf\n|       `--  ports.conf\n|-- mods-enabled\n|       |-- *.load\n|       `-- *.conf\n|-- conf-enabled\n|       `-- *.conf\n|-- sites-enabled\n|       `-- *.conf\n          \n\n\napache2.conf is the main configuration\n                           file. It puts the pieces together by including all remaining configuration\n                           files when starting up the web server.\n                        \n\nports.conf is always included from the\n                           main configuration file. It is used to determine the listening ports for\n                           incoming connections, and this file can be customized anytime.\n                        \n\n                           Configuration files in the mods-enabled/,\n                           conf-enabled/ and sites-enabled/ directories contain\n                           particular configuration snippets which manage modules, global configuration\n                           fragments, or virtual host configurations, respectively.\n                        \n\n                           They are activated by symlinking available\n                           configuration files from their respective\n                           *-available/ counterparts. These should be managed\n                           by using our helpers\n                           \n                                a2enmod,\n                                a2dismod,\n                           \n\n                                a2ensite,\n                                a2dissite,\n                            \n                                and\n                           \n                                a2enconf,\n                                a2disconf\n                           . See their respective man pages for detailed information.\n                        \n\n                           The binary is called apache2. Due to the use of\n                           environment variables, in the default configuration, apache2 needs to be\n                           started/stopped with /etc/init.d/apache2 or apache2ctl.\n                           Calling /usr/bin/apache2 directly will not work with the\n                           default configuration.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n                Document Roots\n        \n\n\n                By default, Ubuntu does not allow access through the web browser to\n                any file apart of those located in /var/www,\n                public_html\n                directories (when enabled) and /usr/share (for web\n                applications). If your site is using a web document root\n                located elsewhere (such as in /srv) you may need to whitelist your\n                document root directory in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf.\n            \n\n                The default Ubuntu document root is /var/www/html. You\n                can make your own virtual hosts under /var/www. This is different\n                to previous releases which provides better security out of the box.\n            \n\n\n\n                Reporting Problems\n        \n\n\n                Please use the ubuntu-bug tool to report bugs in the\n                Apache2 package with Ubuntu. However, check existing bug reports before reporting a new bug.\n          \n\n                Please report bugs specific to modules (such as PHP and others)\n                to respective packages, not to the web server itself.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Instead, milkmen delivered dairy in reusable glass bottles. This zero-waste model inspired Alex Torrey WG21 and Byungwoo Ko WG20 to create The Rounds, a subscription service that keeps subscribers stocked with necessities like toiletries, dry goods, and, yes, milk, at least of the non-dairy variety. Just like milkmen — the startup was originally named Mlkmn — subscribers avoid single-use plastic.

Now, AptDeco is expanding with its launch of national shipping and is the only end-to-end marketplace that accepts all kinds of furniture resale items, from futons to rugs to floor lamps. “As we look to the future of the furniture industry, we recognize the importance of the role we play in changing consumer mind-sets around used furniture. With this expansion, anyone can easily participate in a circular economy,” says Fagiri, who serves as AptDeco’s CEO.\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\nAboveBoard\n\n                                            Lucinda Duncalfe C85 WG91 is on a mission to disrupt the traditional executive search process, which usually relies on word of mouth within established networks and expensive headhunting.

Employers can post job listings on AboveBoard and immediately reach a diverse group of candidates.

We believe this is an area of teacher knowledge and ability that is not well understood or developed in teacher education or professional development, but is central to what teachers do on a daily basis. It is our view that understanding and improving curriculum use is critical to improving teaching at scale.\nThe ICUBiT project is directed by Janine Remillard (Penn) and Ok-Kyeong Kim (WMU) and is run by a team of researchers at Western Michigan University and the University of Pennsylvania. We are guided by an expert team of advisors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. 091841 and 0918126.

The expertise and interests of members of the group are diverse and heterogeneous. What unites us is the enterprise of building historical narratives from the fragmentary and diffuse textual and material evidence available to us. Students admitted to the Graduate Group in Ancient History will receive training in the political, intellectual, cultural, socio-economic, and religious history of at least two discrete ancient societies as part of their preparation for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNews and Events\n\n\n  \n\n06/21 Max Dietrich Dissertation Defense\nJune 16, 2023\n \n\n\n06/20 - 22: Penn-Leiden Colloquium on Ancient Values XII: Meanings and Values of the Sacred in Greco-Roman Antiquity\nJune 16, 2023\n \n\n\nGavin Blasdel (ANCH PhD '23): Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Groningen\nMay 31, 2023\n \n\n\nJordan Rogers (ANCH PhD '21): Visiting Assistant Professor and Post-doctoral Fellow in Classics at Hamilton College\nMay 25, 2023\n \n \n\n\n    More News >  \n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nContact\nChair: Julia Wilker 234 Cohen Hall, 249 South 36th StreetUniversity of PennsylvaniaPhiladelphia, PA 19104-6304wilker@sas.upenn.edu\n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\nGraduate Coordinator: Katelyn Stoler 236 Cohen Hall, 249 South 36th StreetUniversity of PennsylvaniaPhiladelphia, PA 19104-6304(215) 573-0250kastoler@upenn.edu\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPenn WebLogin\n \n\n© 2023 The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n \n\n\n",

This vertical rule is lettristic and in my practice the letters are capitalized. Between two capitals in a perfect or 100% mesostic neither letter may appear in lower case. .... In the writing of the wing words, the horizontal text, the letters of the vertical string help me out of sentimentality. I have something to do, a puzzle to solve. This way of responding makes me feel in this respect one with the Japanese people, who formerly, I once learned, turned their letter writing into the writing of poems. In taking the next step in my work, the exploration of nonintention, I don't solve the puzzle that the mesostic string presents. Instead I write or find a source text which is then used as an oracle. I ask it what word shall I use for this letter and what one for the next, etc. This frees me from memory, taste, likes, and dislikes, By means of Mesolist, a program by Jim Rosenberg, all words that satisfy the mesostic rule are listed. IC [a program that generates the I Ching numbers, available for downloading on the Net] then chooses which words in the lists are to be used and gives me all the central words, the position of each in the source material identified by page, line, and column. I then add all the wing words from the source text following of course the rule Mesolist does within the limit of forty-five characters to the right and the same to the left. Then I take out the words I don't want. With respect to the source material, I am in a global situation. Words come first from here and then from there. The situation is not linear. It is as though I am in a forest hunting for ideas.\" --John Cage\n                \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nnumber of mesostics?\n \n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nwhere do stanzas break?\n \n\n\n\n\nrandomly\n \n \n\n\n\nafter every spine word\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nstrip punctuation?\n \n\n\n\n\nyes\n \n\nno\n \nStrip everything but [a-z][A-Z][0-9]['].\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nhow sparse is the wing text?\n \n\n\n\n\nnormal\n \nNote: The more sparse the wing text, the less likely additional words will be included.\n\n\n\nsparse\n \n \n\n\n\nvery sparse\n \n \n\n\n\nall eligible words included\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nwhich mesostic rule?\n \n\n\n\n\nbasic\n \n \n\n\n\n50% rule\n \nThe 50% rule does not permit the second spine letter to appear between spine letters.\n \n\n\n\n100% rule\n \nThe 100% rule does not permit either spine letter to appear between spine letters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate\nClear\n\nabout the project\n\n",

Linguistics is also concerned with how languages are learned and used, how they vary and change, and the relationship of language to cognition, biology, and society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania has a longstanding reputation for using diverse kinds of empirical data to advance linguistic theory. Known for its interdisciplinary research, the department not only spans the subfields of linguistics but also connects with many other fields in cognitive science and beyond.

During April through June of 2018, the Penn Social Norms Group (Penn SoNG) conducted focus groups together with a second wave of survey data collection to understand the social determinants of open defecation as well as surrounding collective practices in India.\n\nWe also included a complementary qualitative research component to assess relevant groups’ opinions, experiences, and challenges related to the collective practices we are studying. With these combined qualitative and quantitative data we now finally have the capacity to link social norms and social network data for the first time, allowing us to comprehensively analyze collective behaviors in the context of the networks in which they are embedded.\n\n\n \nWhy False Beliefs Drive Acceptance of Corruption\n\n\nPennSoNG Member Raj Patel explains the importance of measuring institutionalized corruption before testing as social norms to see what factors drive behavioral patterns. He talks about how surveying social norms can expose assumptions among individuals that certain behaviors are widely accepted, whereas in reality acceptance is low. Challenging these false beliefs can hugely improve the impact of collective action in changing behavior.\n\nRaj also outlines how societal change can happen quickly (within a single generation) because enough people’s values change at once or there is a realization that a majority within society feel the same way about certain behaviors. LINK TO THE VIDEO from Chatham House.\n\n\n \nFreedoms, Inequality and Social Change\n\n\nWe are excited to begin a new research project in the spring investigating the relationship between perceptions of inequality and perceptions of freedom. Our main hypothesis is that perceptions of freedom and autonomy shape perceptions of inequality, and vice versa. As people perceive themselves and others as having less autonomy/freedom – they also perceive greater inequality, especially inequality of opportunity. \nConversely, when people perceive themselves as having greater freedom, they also perceive less inequality and enhanced opportunity. A corollary of this hypothesis is that changes in perceived inequality over time affect people’s perception of autonomy such that perceptions of increasing inequality will further decrease perceptions of autonomy/freedom. Does perceiving an “inequality trajectory” affect our sense of autonomy/freedom? How much?\n\n\n \nChild Marriage and Malnutrition in Mali\n\n\nPenn SoNG members Sam Gant and Rachel Sander recently returned to Philadelphia from a three-week trip to Mali.  They are collaborating with UNICEF to research the social expectations and reference networks that maintain child marriage and malnutrition.\n\nIn February 2019, a SoNG-designed survey will be deployed to 6,000 respondents in two regions of the country.  Results of this survey will inform UNICEF’s national-level strategy for communications and collective behavioral change.  Final results are anticipated in June 2019.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Penn-UNICEF Partnership\nFrom 2010-2015, UNICEF staff from all over the world and from all backgrounds fly to Philadelphia to participate in our program.

Our group generates ideas with and for Philadelphia math teachers. The CBMP website is designed to cultivate a community of math teachers interested in locally relevant curriculum by providing a place to find and share lesson plans and experiences.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Lesson Idea Portal!\nWe are excited to share our work, and invite you to join our professional learning community. The lessons on this site have been aligned with the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM) and are designed to be a resource to use along with any math curriculum. Although these lessons were developed to reflect the urban context of Philadelphia, they can easily be adapted for use in any locale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBrowse our Collection!\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur History\nCBMP began in the summer of 2009 with a group of middle school math teachers from Philadelphia and graduate students and faculty members at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education. After finding that the contexts used in the existing math curriculum were not familiar to the youth living in this urban community, we redesigned them to include settings and situations that were more relevant to the middle school students. The initial goal of the project was to develop materials that were engaging for students, relevant to their urban community, aligned to state standards, and infused with social justice goals.\nFounding members included teachers Kelley Collings and Suzanne Reimann, and graduate students Nina Hoe, Vivian Lim, Emily Magee, and Luke Reinke.\nOver time, the project became a professional learning community. Participants work together to adapt math lessons for the classroom, share their experiences and questions, and develop new lessons based on local contexts and their students' lived experiences. In addition to the lessons, we have presented and written about our work in several conferences and publications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Publication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n Increasing Access to Mathematics through Locally Relevant Curriculum \n In K.

The designation of IMS Fellow has been a significant honor for over 85 years. Each Fellow is assessed by a committee of their peers and has demonstrated distincition in research or leadership that has profoundly influenced the field. Read the complete list of 2023 IMS Fellows. \n \n   \n\n  \n Farrar and Schisterman Named to National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Ad-hoc Committees \n Earlier this year, John Farrar, MD, PhD and Enrique Schisterman, PhD were named to National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine ad-hoc committees.\nFarrar serves on “Evaluating the Effects of Opioids and Benzodiazepines on All-Cause Mortality in Veterans.\" Due to the effects of active duty and combat-related injuries, among other potential predisposing factors, the Veterans Administration population has higher rates of chronic pain, traumatic brain injury, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, substance use disorder, and accompanying mental health problems than civilians. Those often co-occurring conditions increase the risk for suicidal ideation and suicide. Veterans may be prescribed opioids (for pain) and benzodiazepines (for anxiety or insomnia). The committee will conduct a study to evaluate the effects of opioids and benzodiazepines on all-cause mortality of veterans, including suicide.\nSchisterman serves on “Developing a Framework to Address Legal, Ethical, Regulatory, and Policy Issues for Research Specific to Pregnant and Lactating Persons.\" Approximately 4 million pregnant people in the United States give birth annually, and 70 percent of these individuals take at least one prescription medication during their pregnancy. Yet, pregnant and lactating persons are often excluded from clinical trials, and often have to make treatment decisions without an adequate understanding of the benefits and risks to themselves and their developing fetus or newborn baby. The committee will develop a framework for addressing medicolegal and liability issues when planning or conducting research specific to pregnant and lactating persons.\n \n   \n\n\nView More Announcements \n \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the News\n\n\n\n\n\n Examining Places Where People Experiencing Homelessness Overdose \n February 2023 \n Elizabeth Nesoff, PhD, MPH discusses her recently published study in the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics (LDI) blog investigating neighborhood features that were correlated with fatal opioid overdoses among the homeless population in New York City. Dr. Nesoff uses these discoveries to make important policy recommendations with respect to targeted outreach and other interventions.\n  \n\n Researchers examine measles antibodies in pregnant patients at 2 Philadelphia Hospitals \n February 2023 \n Jeffrey Morris, PhD and Jeffrey Gerber, MD, PhD, MSCE collaborated with researchers to examine measles serostatus among pregnant persons about to give birth and whether rubella serostatus, which is routinely assessed during pregnancy, can serve as a proxy for measles serostatus.\n  \n\n Podcast focuses on developing new ways to identify aggressive breast cancer \n January 2023 \n Anne Marie McCarthy, PhD was featured on the Real Pink Podcast where she discussed the development of new ways to identify people with high risk of aggressive breast cancer. \n  \n\n\nView More News \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DBEI distinctively brings together expertise in biostatistics, epidemiology and informatics, to advance population-health science.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\n Third Penn Conference on Big Data in Biomedical and Population Health Sciences \n  September 18, 2023\n(All day)\n \n   \n\n Third Penn Conference on Big Data in Biomedical and Population Health Sciences \n  September 19, 2023\n(All day)\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Research\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n With Climate Change, More Cases of Kidney Stones  \n Epidemiology \n   \n\n Masking Policies for Covid-19: What Does the Science Say? \n Biostatistics \n   \n\n Turning the Tables on Diseases that Spread Spatially  \n Biostatistics \n   \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nTo understand health and disease today, we need new thinking and novel science —the kind  we create when multiple disciplines work together from the ground up. That is why this department has put forward a bold vision in population-health science: a single academic home for biostatistics, epidemiology and informatics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2023 Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania.

In our computational investigations, we build mathematical and computer-simulation models to account for the dynamics of memory retrieval in a variety of episodic and spatial memory tasks.  Because behavioral data provides a sparse reflection of the brain’s activity supporting memory, we simultaneously record neurophysiological signals as patients with arrays of implanted electrodes perform memory tasks.  In these investigations we study neural activity at multiple spatial scales, ranging from individual neurons to spatially-distributed networks of field-potential activity supporting memory.  Several of our current projects also use electrical stimulation to manipulate memory circuits, both for understanding basic memory mechanisms and also for developing therapies to restore memory in patients with brain injury or neurological disease. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nFoundations of Human Memoryby Michael J. KahanaPlease click here for more information and errata.\n\n\n\n\n\nComputational models of human memory\nTo help explain the processes underlying encoding, organization and retrieval of episodic memories, we have developed, extended and refined a class of models based on the idea that items in memory become associated with a time-varying representation of spatio-temporal context.  The temporal context model (TCM; Howard and Kahana, 2002 and TCM-A Sederberg, Howard, and Kahana, 2008) sought to explain the time-scale invariance of recency and contiguity effects in free recall, and dissociations between recall of recent and remote memories. Subsequent modeling work generalized TCM beyond temporal context to account for the influence of semantic knowledge on recall dynamics (CMR, Polyn, Norman, and Kahana (2009)). MATLAB scripts to run the CMR model can be downloaded here.  \n Lohnas, Polyn, and Kahana (2015) provided a major overhaul of the earlier CMR model, going beyond earlier modeling of individual lists to explain the interaction between memories learned across multiple experiences .    In their CMR2 model, memory accumulates across multiple experimental lists, and temporal context is used both to focus retrieval on a target list and to censor retrieved information when its match to the current context indicates that it was learned in a non-target list. The model simultaneously accounts for a wide range of intralist and interlist phenomena, including the pattern of prior-list intrusions observed in free recall, build-up of and release from proactive interference, and the ability to selectively target retrieval of items on specific prior lists (Jang & Huber, 2008; Shiffrin, 1970). Healey and Kahana (2015) used CMR2 to better understand why memory tends to get worse as we age. By fitting CMR2 to the performance of individual younger and older adults, they identified deficits in four critical processes: sustaining attention across a study episode, generating retrieval cues, resolving competition, and screening for inaccurate memories (intrusions). Healey and Kahana also extended CMR2 to simulate a recognition memory task using the same mechanisms the free recall model uses to reject intrusions. Without fitting any additional parameters, the model accounts for age differences in recognition memory accuracy. Confirming a prediction of the model, free recall intrusion rates correlate positively with recognition false alarm rates. MATLAB scripts to run the CMR2 model can be downloaded here.  Cohen and Kahana (2021, Psychological Review) introduced CMR3 to include the critical role of arousal and emotion in human memory.  They applied their model to diverse phenomena including the role of emotion in organizing memories, state-dependent and mood congruent memory, the role of emotional experiences in producing persistent mood states, including depression, and a novel account of PTSD and its treatment.  \nA review of this line of research appeared in Kahana (2020), Computational Models of Memory Search, in the Annual Review of Psychology.  Python code that runs CMR2 and CMR3 may be downloaded from the lab's publication page.\n\n\n\n\n Fig. 1: The context-maintenance and retrieval model. A. Schematic of CMR. When an item is studied its feature representation (fi) is activated on F. The feature representation contains both item and source features (e.g., size / animacy judgment). An associative weight matrix (MFC) allows each item to update a context representation that contains the item and source features of recently studied items. During study, the features of each item are associated with coactive context elements. During recall, the context representation reactivates (through MCF) the features of recently studied items. B. Hypothesized interactions between prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and medial temporal lobe during memory encoding and retrieval predicted by CMR.\n\n click to enlargeFig. 2: Data and CMR2 Simulations. A. This curve shows the probability of making a recall to serial position i+lag immediately following recall of serial position i—that is, the conditional-response probability (CRP) as a function of lag. CMR2 captures older adults' temporal contiguity deficit. B. Release from proactive interference (PI). Participants studied lists of three items, each drawn from the same semantic category. After three lists from the same semantic category, subjects were then presented with a new set of three lists from a different semantic category. Top: Data from Loess (1967), note the scalloped pattern: performance declines across same-category lists and improves when a new category is presented. Bottom: CMR2 simulations capture the release from PI pattern. C. CMR2 simulations of hit and false alarm rates in recognition. D. As predicted by CMR2, recognition false alarm rates correlate with free recall intrusion rates.\n\nNeural and oscillatory correlates of episodic memory\nWe investigate the neurophysiology of episodic memory with electrocorticographic (ECoG) and single neuron recordings from neurosurgical patients who have had electrodes surgically implanted on the cortical surface of the brain or in the medial temporal lobes (including hippocampus) as part of the clinical process of localizing seizure foci. One focus of this research is to determine the oscillatory correlates of successful episodic memory formation and retrieval. Analyses of such recordings have shown that high-frequency activity (HFA, 70-150 Hz) increase while participants are studying words that they will successfully, as opposed to unsuccessfully, recall.  HFA also rises just prior to successful vocal free recall (reviewed in Burke et al., 2015; for a video of the encoding effects click here  here ) for a video of the retrieval effect click here  here ).  \n\n\n\n\n Fig. 3: Free Recall Paradigm By using a free recall task in which participants study a list of words, we can measure episodic memory formation by comparing the spectral correlates associated with encoding items that are later recalled (red) or forgotten (blue). We record electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from subdurally implanted electrodes in patients with medically intractable epilepsy. We can extract spectral signals (power of a given frequency) from the raw EEG voltage traces for each item and measure when and where power at particular frequencies changes. Successful memory formation is associated with increases in HFA in left lateral temporal lobe, medial temporal lobe, and left prefrontal cortex.  The same analyses can be performed on items during recall to assess when and where memories are retrieved. Successful memory retrieval is associated with increases in gamma band activity in the left neocortex and hippocampus as well as increases in theta band (4 -8 Hz) activity in right temporal lobe.  \n\n\nThe ability to reinstate this contextual information during memory search has been considered a hallmark of episodic, or event-based, memory. In Manning et al., 2011, we sought to determine whether contextual reinstatement may be observed in electrical signals recorded from the human brain during episodic recall. We examined ECoG activity from 69 neurosurgical patients as they studied and recalled lists of words in a delayed free recall paradigm (Fig. 4A), and computed similarity between the ECoG patterns recorded just prior to each recall with those recorded after the patient had studied each word. We found that, upon recalling a studied word, the recorded patterns of brain activity were not only similar to the patterns observed when the word was studied, but were also similar to the patterns observed during study of neighboring list words, with similarity decreasing reliably with positional distance (Fig. 4C), just as predicted by context reinstatement models of free recall. The degree to which individual patients exhibited this neural signature of contextual reinstatement was correlated with the contiguity effect as seen in Fig. 4D. In this way, the study provides neural evidence for contextual reinstatement in humans.\n\n\n\n Fig. 4: Neural evidence for contextual reinstatement in humans. A. After studying a list of 20 words and performing a brief distraction task, a participant recalls as many words as he can remember, in any order. ECoG activity is recorded during each study and recall event. The similarity between the recorded patterns is computed as a function of lag. B. Each dot marks the location of a single electrode [temporal lobe (1,815 electrodes), frontal lobe (1,737 electrodes), parietal lobe (512 electrodes), and occipital lobe (138 electrodes)]. C. Similarity between the activity recorded during recall of a word from serial position i and study of a word from serial position i + lag. (Black dot denotes study and recall of the same word, i.e., lag = 0.) D. Participants exhibiting stronger neural signatures of context reinstatement also exhibited more pronounced contiguity effects (as measured by a percentile-based temporal clustering score). (Figure after Manning et al., 2011.)\n\nHuman spatial memory and cognition\nOur lab is also interested in the neural mechanisms underlying human spatial cognition.  In this work, we use virtual reality computer games in which participants learn the locations of landmarks in virtual environments. To download a sample of a YellowCab session, click here.  Using this approach, we have documented the existence and character of the 4-8 Hz theta rhythm in the human brain as participants learned to navigate through complex virtual environments (Kahana et al., 1999; Caplan et al., 2001; Caplan et al., 2003; Ekstrom et al., 2005; Jacobs et al., 2010a).  Recording individual neurons during virtual navigation, we have discovered \"place cells\" in the human brain. These cells, which are found primarily in the human hippocampus, become active when a given spatial location is being traversed (Ekstrom et al., 2003). We also identified several other cellular responses during navigation: cells that become active in response to viewing a salient landmark (from any location), cells that become active when searching for a particular goal location (irrespective of location or view), and cells that respond when traveling in a given direction (bearing/heading).\nJacobs et al. (2010b) examined recordings of single-neuron activity from neurosurgical patients playing a virtual-navigation video game. In addition to place cells, which encode the current virtual location, we describe a unique cell type, entorhinal cortex (EC) path cells, the activity of which indicates whether the patient is taking a clockwise or counterclockwise path around the virtual square road. We find that many EC path cells exhibit this directional activity throughout the environment, in contrast to hippocampal neurons, which primarily encode information about specific locations. More broadly, these findings support the hypothesis that EC encodes general properties of the current context (e.g., location or direction) that are used by hippocampus to build unique representations reflecting combinations of these properties.\nGrid cells in the entorhinal cortex appear to represent spatial location via a triangular coordinate system. Such cells, which have been identified in rats, bats and monkeys, are believed to support a wide range of spatial behaviors. Recording neuronal activity from neurosurgical patients performing a virtual-navigation task, Jacobs et al. (2013) identified cells exhibiting grid-like spiking patterns in the human brain, suggesting that humans and simpler animals rely on homologous spatial-coding schemes.\nTheories of episodic memory suggest that memory encoding and retrieval are facilitated by spatiotemporal context: a continually updated representation of location in space and time. Recent work in the lab sought to examine the role of spatial context in human episodic memory retrieval through a hybrid spatial and episodic memory task. Miller et al. (2013) identified place cells as neurosurgical patients performed a delivery task which required them to deliver items to different stores in a virtual town. Following this navigation task, patients were asked to freely recall the items they had delivered. Place cell activation patterns during the navigational task were then compared to the subsequent activation patterns that occurred during the free recall task. Miller et al. found that neural activity during the retrieval of each delivered item was similar to the neural activity associated with the location where that item was encoded. These findings demonstrate context-specific reinstatement of place-responsive cell activity at the time of recall, supporting theories that implicate contextual reinstatement as the basis for memory retrieval.\n\n\n Fig. 5: Place responsive cells. (a) Firing-rate maps for a cell responsive to northward traversals located in the hippocampus of one of the participants. (b) A cell responsive to eastward traversals recorded from a participant's entorhinal cortex. (c) Regional distribution of place-responsive cells across the entire data set of 371 single units (H, hippocampus; A, amygdala; EC, entorhinal cortex; PHG, parahippocampal gyrus; Ant, anterior medial temporal lobe).\n\n Fig. 6: Spatial context reinstatement.

Shaded regions indicate SEM across recalled items, the horizontal bars indicate statistically significant time points and the vertical dotted line indicates the onset of vocalization. (b) Average neural similarity for near, middle and far distance bins for the time period of -300 to 700ms relative to recall onset. Error bars indicate SEM across recalled items. (c) Neural similarity for near and far spatial distance bins for each participants (colored lines) and the participant average (black line) during -300 to 700ms relative to recall onset. Error bars indicate SEM across participants.\n\n\n\n\nCognitive Neuromodulation\nThe lab is also interested in how electrical stimulation can be used to therapeutically modulate memory function. The RAM project, supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), is a large-scale collaboration in which we use intracranial recording and stimulation to understand and affect memory function. By aggregating data collection from intracranial patients at many clinical centers, we are able to study in detail the neural mechanisms of memory encoding and retrieval across four tasks that address many core memory processes: free recall, categorized free recall, paired associate learning and spatial navigation. During performance of these tasks, we apply targeted electrical stimulation to specific nodes in the memory network, including the hippocampus, medial temporal lobe cortices and the frontal cortex. We then use multivariate machine learning methods to analyze the effects of stimulation on brain activity, and their relationship to memory performance. Our ultimate goal is to use this knowledge to understand how electrical stimulation can be used to treat memory dysfunction.\n\n\n Figure 7: Closed-loop system for neuromodulation. Patients studied lists of words shown on a laptop screen while another computer monitored signals recorded from electrodes implanted directly in the brain. The computer analyzed the brain signals during learning to predict whether the patient would later remember the word. If the prediction was that the patient would forget the word, the computer triggered electrical stimulation to the lateral temporal lobe to improve learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\tRetrieved from \"https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/mediawiki/index.php?title=Main_Page&oldid=7531\"\t\t\t\t\t\nCategory: Public \n\n\n\nNavigation menu\n\n\nPersonal tools\n\nLog in \n\n\n\nNamespaces\n\nMain page\nDiscussion\n\n\n\n\nVariants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViews\n\nRead\nView source\nView history\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic pages\n\n\nResearchIn the MediaDirectionsOpen positionsCEMSMBCPublicationsPostersPeopleRestoring Active Memory (RAM)PEERSOxford Handbook of Human MemoryBehavioral data archiveCognitive electrophysiology data portalSoftwareWord PoolsAll public pages \n\n\n\nInternal Wiki\n\n\nMain Page (login req.) \n\n\n\nTools\n\n\nWhat links hereRelated changesSpecial pagesPrintable versionPermanent linkPage information \n\n\n\n\n\n\n This page was last modified on 12 October 2022, at 17:15.\n\n\nPrivacy policy\nAbout Computational Memory Lab\nDisclaimers\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Wilson, MD, PhD, reflects on 10 years of leading Penn’s Orphan Disease Center.\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States, orphan diseases represent a collection of disorders that afflict fewer than 200,000 individuals for any single disease type. There are more than 7,000 distinct orphan diseases.\nIn the aggregate, over 25 million people in the United States suffer substantial morbidity and mortality from orphan diseases. Despite this huge number, research in most disease types has lagged far behind other major areas due to a combination of technological and funding limitations.The Orphan Disease Center of the University of Pennsylvania exists to facilitate and fund research, and develop transformative therapies for rare diseases with significant unmet need.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe aim to make rare disease research accessible, collaborative, and sustainable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrograms & Initiatives\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrant OpportunitiesThe ODC offers over 50 grant opportunities in 30+ disease areas annually to researchers across the globe, as well as within the Penn and CHOP community. Since 2011, our grant programs have funded $37.6 million in rare disease research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJumpStartThe JumpStart program serves to establish and progress research agendas in emerging and neglected rare diseases. The JumpStart program partners with patient groups and families to address gaps by identifying key opinion leaders and introducing new researchers to a disease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMillion Dollar Bike RideThe ODC is proud to partner with 30+ disease teams made up of patients, caregivers, foundations and family members who tirelessly raise much-needed funds for research grants.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiseases We Study\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDKL5 Deficiency Disorder (CDD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMucopolysaccharidoses\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nContact UsMillion Dollar Bike Ride EventsCareersJoin Our Mailing List!\n\n\n\n\n    Make A Gift\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of PennsylvaniaTRL Suite 1200125 South 31st StreetPhiladelphia PA 19104\n\n\n\nThe Orphan Disease Center is part of the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Medicine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

If you can read this page it means that this site is working properly. This server is powered by CentOS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust visiting?\nThe website you just visited is either experiencing problems or is undergoing routine maintenance.\nIf you would like to let the administrators of this website know that you've seen this page instead of the page you expected, you should send them e-mail. In general, mail sent to the name \"webmaster\" and directed to the website's domain should reach the appropriate person.\nFor example, if you experienced problems while visiting www.example.com, you should send e-mail to \"webmaster@example.com\".\n\n\nAre you the Administrator?\nYou should add your website content to the directory /var/www/html/.\nTo prevent this page from ever being used, follow the instructions in the file /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf.\nPromoting Apache and CentOS\nYou are free to use the images below on Apache and CentOS Linux powered HTTP servers.  Thanks for using Apache and CentOS!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant note:\nThe CentOS Project has nothing to do with this website or its content,\n            it just provides the software that makes the website run.\nIf you have issues with the content of this site, contact the owner of the domain, not the CentOS project. \n            Unless you intended to visit CentOS.org, the CentOS Project does not have anything to do with this website,\n            the content or the lack of it.\nFor example, if this website is www.example.com, you would find the owner of the example.com domain at the following WHOIS server:\nhttp://www.internic.net/whois.html\n\n\nThe CentOS Project\nThe CentOS Linux distribution is a stable, predictable, manageable and reproduceable platform derived from \n               the sources of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).\nAdditionally to being a popular choice for web hosting, CentOS also provides a rich platform for open source communities to build upon.

During April through June of 2018, the Penn Social Norms Group (Penn SoNG) conducted focus groups together with a second wave of survey data collection to understand the social determinants of open defecation as well as surrounding collective practices in India.\n\nWe also included a complementary qualitative research component to assess relevant groups’ opinions, experiences, and challenges related to the collective practices we are studying. With these combined qualitative and quantitative data we now finally have the capacity to link social norms and social network data for the first time, allowing us to comprehensively analyze collective behaviors in the context of the networks in which they are embedded.\n\n\n \nWhy False Beliefs Drive Acceptance of Corruption\n\n\nPennSoNG Member Raj Patel explains the importance of measuring institutionalized corruption before testing as social norms to see what factors drive behavioral patterns. He talks about how surveying social norms can expose assumptions among individuals that certain behaviors are widely accepted, whereas in reality acceptance is low. Challenging these false beliefs can hugely improve the impact of collective action in changing behavior.\n\nRaj also outlines how societal change can happen quickly (within a single generation) because enough people’s values change at once or there is a realization that a majority within society feel the same way about certain behaviors. LINK TO THE VIDEO from Chatham House.\n\n\n \nFreedoms, Inequality and Social Change\n\n\nWe are excited to begin a new research project in the spring investigating the relationship between perceptions of inequality and perceptions of freedom. Our main hypothesis is that perceptions of freedom and autonomy shape perceptions of inequality, and vice versa. As people perceive themselves and others as having less autonomy/freedom – they also perceive greater inequality, especially inequality of opportunity. \nConversely, when people perceive themselves as having greater freedom, they also perceive less inequality and enhanced opportunity. A corollary of this hypothesis is that changes in perceived inequality over time affect people’s perception of autonomy such that perceptions of increasing inequality will further decrease perceptions of autonomy/freedom. Does perceiving an “inequality trajectory” affect our sense of autonomy/freedom? How much?\n\n\n \nChild Marriage and Malnutrition in Mali\n\n\nPenn SoNG members Sam Gant and Rachel Sander recently returned to Philadelphia from a three-week trip to Mali.  They are collaborating with UNICEF to research the social expectations and reference networks that maintain child marriage and malnutrition.\n\nIn February 2019, a SoNG-designed survey will be deployed to 6,000 respondents in two regions of the country.  Results of this survey will inform UNICEF’s national-level strategy for communications and collective behavioral change.  Final results are anticipated in June 2019.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Penn-UNICEF Partnership\nFrom 2010-2015, UNICEF staff from all over the world and from all backgrounds fly to Philadelphia to participate in our program.

A classic example of distributed genomic processes is found in neurons. Learning and memory requires modulation of individual synapses through RNA localization, localized translation, and localized metabolites such as those from dendritic mitochondria. Dendrites of neurons integrate distributed synaptic signals into both electrical and nuclear transcriptional response. Dysfunction of these distributed genomic functions in neurons can result in a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric diseases such as bipolar and depressive disorders, autism, among others.\nThe Center for Sub-Cellular Genomics’ (CSG) mission is to develop new technologies to enable the dissection of complex genomic interactions within a single cell. New technologies include methods to target DNA and RNA sampling at sub-cellular resolution in live cells; high-throughput isolation and microfluidics chemistry for sub-cellular fractions; sub-cellular resolution mass-spectrometry; and computational tools for analysis of sub-cellular genomics data.\nThe new technologies developed by CSG will enable the broader genomics community to associate sub-cellular processes to cell function and dysfunction. These technologies will be utilized in the center to generate a comprehensive atlas of genomic signatures of sub-cellular compartments in the mammalian neuron system. The technologies and neuron-focused data obtained here will be relevant to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases including Schizophrenia, Depression, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Traumatic Brain Injury, and Alzheimer’s. \n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n2022 NOVEMBER\nAnnouncing DAPPG\nApply now for the Diversity Action Plan for PENN Genomics (DAPPG) program, aimed to increase the number of UR students choosing a career in genome sciences and genomic medicine...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\t\t  © 2018 U Penn.

If your PennKey username (PennName) is unavailable, consider using yourpennname-upenn (i.e. bfrankln-upenn). Since GitHub account names are not unique to the upenn organization, do not assume that a GitHub account belongs to a Penn affiliate because it is the same as someone’s PennName.\nAll members of the upenn GitHub organization are required to have two-factor authentication enabled on their GitHub accounts. If you have not done so already, see these instructions (be sure to save your recovery codes when prompted):\n\nConfiguring two-factor authentication\n\nAfter logging into your GitHub account (with two-factor authentication enabled), visit this URL to authenticate with your PennKey and automatically become a member of the upenn GitHub organization:\n\nhttps://github.com/orgs/upenn/sso/sign_up\n\nNote that you can associate your Penn WebLogin SSO identity with any of your GitHub accounts, but only one can be associated at a time. You will also be required to enable Two-factor authentication on your GitHub account, if you haven’t done so already.\nWARNING: GitHub is not suitable for storing sensitive information, including:\n\nData subject to FERPA rules\nHIPAA protected information\nUnencrypted secrets such as passwords or private keys\n\nWhy use Penn’s Github Campus Program?\nBenefits:\n\nProtected by Penn WebLogin SSO\nGitHub Teams for cascading access permissions\nStandardized infrastructure available to University\nSecurity features enforced across all repositories in the enterprise\nSecurity Vulnerability Alerts for vulnerable repos\nEnterprise support for GitHub Classroom and integration with Canvas\nExternal collaboration with nonmembers is supported\nContinued access to code repostories is resilient to developer turnover\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublished with GitHub Pages\n\n\n\n\n",

Our group generates ideas with and for Philadelphia math teachers. The CBMP website is designed to cultivate a community of math teachers interested in locally relevant curriculum by providing a place to find and share lesson plans and experiences.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Lesson Idea Portal!\nWe are excited to share our work, and invite you to join our professional learning community. The lessons on this site have been aligned with the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM) and are designed to be a resource to use along with any math curriculum. Although these lessons were developed to reflect the urban context of Philadelphia, they can easily be adapted for use in any locale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBrowse our Collection!\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur History\nCBMP began in the summer of 2009 with a group of middle school math teachers from Philadelphia and graduate students and faculty members at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education. After finding that the contexts used in the existing math curriculum were not familiar to the youth living in this urban community, we redesigned them to include settings and situations that were more relevant to the middle school students. The initial goal of the project was to develop materials that were engaging for students, relevant to their urban community, aligned to state standards, and infused with social justice goals.\nFounding members included teachers Kelley Collings and Suzanne Reimann, and graduate students Nina Hoe, Vivian Lim, Emily Magee, and Luke Reinke.\nOver time, the project became a professional learning community. Participants work together to adapt math lessons for the classroom, share their experiences and questions, and develop new lessons based on local contexts and their students' lived experiences. In addition to the lessons, we have presented and written about our work in several conferences and publications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Publication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n Increasing Access to Mathematics through Locally Relevant Curriculum \n In K.

The first is academically based community service (ABCS), service rooted in and intrinsically connected to research, teaching, and learning. The second is university-assisted community schools (UACS), which educate, engage, empower, and serve not only students, but also all other members of the community, providing an organizing framework for bringing our programs, including ABCS courses, to West Philadelphia schools. Third, we view ABCS and UACS as core to a comprehensive anchor institution strategy in which universities engage in sustained, mutually beneficial partnerships with their communities. These strategies are shared with others across the country and around the world, serving as a model for democratic university-community engagement.\n\n\n Learn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nABCS Courses Over 70 Academically Based Community Service (ABCS) courses each year engage faculty and students across the university in real-world problem solving.\n \n \nLearn More \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrograms Partnerships with local schools and organizations work to advance literacy, STEM education, health and nutrition, post-secondary success, sports and fitness, arts and culture, and community economic development.\n \nLearn More \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“An Inclination join’d with an Ability to serve Mankind, one’s Country, Friends and Family... should be the great Aim and End of all learning.”\nBenjamin Franklin (1749)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur Work Depends on People\n.....\nThe Netter Center provides students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members a variety of ways to get involved in the Netter Center's work in West Philadelphia and beyond.\n\n\nLearn how you can get involved\n\nEngage with our programsWork at the Netter CenterVolunteerDonateTake or teach an ABCS courseVisit Us \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews \n\n\nOde to Ira - Feature by Penn Gazette\n\n\n\nCommunity, Centered - Feature by Penn Development\n\n\n\n30 years of community partnerships\n\n\n\n\n\n    See All News  \n\n \n\nEvents \n\n\nNo Upcoming Events!\nWe don’t have any events scheduled at the moment, but you can click below to check out some of our past events.\nView Our Past Events\n \n\n\n    See All Events  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect With Us\n\n\nTwitter\nInstagram\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\nKeep Updated\n\n\nSign up to receive our quarterly newsletters, and special announcements from time to time.\nSign up\n \n\n\n\n\n\nInformation for Participants\nFor Penn StudentsFor Penn FacultyFor Penn StaffFor Community PartnersFor Penn Alumni \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBarbara and Edward Netter Center for Community Partnerships\n\tUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\tSt. Leonard's Court\n\t3819-33 Chestnut Street, Suite 120\n\tPhiladelphia, PA 19104-3171\n215-898-5351\nnettercenter@upenn.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\nTwitter\nFacebook\nInstagram\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Do\nGet Involved\nAbout the Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\nContact Us\nNews\nEvents\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2017 Barbara and Edward Netter Center for Community Partnerships\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n",

Even as we gain answers, questions remain about the origins and evolution of the universe and the fundamental theories of matter and energy. The Center for Particle Cosmology brings together theorists and experimentalists in cosmology and particle physics to answer these questions in an environment distinguished by unfettered interactions and collaborations between members of the traditionally distinct groups. \nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\n\n\nElon Musk Public Lecture \nRittenhouse Lectures \nHET and HEE Seminars \nAstro Seminars \n\n\n\n\n\nThere are no upcoming events scheduled at this time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew stellar stream, born outside the Milky Way, discovered with machine learning\nFinding this new collection of stars, named after Nyx, the Greek goddess of night, was made possible using machine learning tools and simulations of data collected by the Gaia space observatory.\nRead more at Penn Today\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDonate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\nThe Center for Particle Cosmology\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy\n209 South 33rd Street\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104-6396\nBhuvnesh Jain and Mark Troddenco-Directors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege of Arts & Sciences\nGraduate Division\nCollege of Liberal & Professional Studies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2023 The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\n\n\n\nPenn Weblogin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Penn International Master of Public Administration, known as the Penn I-MPA, is an exciting, innovative, skills-based graduate degree program that is expressly dedicated to improving global human well-being by professionally educating, nurturing, and networking present and future problem-solving leaders. \nThe Penn I-MPA takes only one academic year and ten courses to complete. It is an academically cutting-edge cohort model program (all I-MPA degree candidates take all I-MPA courses together and participate in numerous extra-curricular learning experiences together) led by a distinctively interdisciplinary, multinational, and multilingual team of world-class scholars and noted leaders in government, business, and the nonprofit sector who teach, advise, mentor, and inspire our students. In the summer immediately following graduation, IMPA program alumni may be eligible for summer research and service fellowship awards of up to $6,000.\n\nI-MPA degree candidates are educationally equipped and professionally empowered through five interlocking program components, four required and one optional:\n\nCurriculum: Ten well-integrated courses that culminate in advanced individual research and writing capstone paper and two group capstone course projects.\nLanguages: Proficiency in English and proficiency in any one or more of the following five languages: Hindi, Mandarin, Portuguese, Spanish, or Swahili.\nExtra-curricular activities: Extra-curricular experiences including special events and distinguished speakers series.\nAdvising: Year-long, robust, individualized academic advising and career mentoring.\nAlumni fellowships: An optional paid alumni research and service fellowship in the summer following graduation.\n\nThe I-MPA program starts on August 24, 2022, with new student orientation. Classes start with the first semester on August 30, 2022, and finish at the end of the second semester on May 9, 2023.\nRequest information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarn an Ivy League graduate degree in one year \nHear from Penn’s I-MPA Faculty Director, Professor Chao Guo, about the program, its unique cohort model, and innovative curriculum that addresses boundary-spanning leadership.\nIf you are having trouble viewing this video, you can watch it on YouTube.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Zou\nI-MPA ’19, PhD candidate at Penn Graduate School of Education\n“I-MPA offered me a placement among Penn’s engaging community and supportive group of distinguished faculty. I learned about the program at the beginning of my career with Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development, where I served as a liaison between policymakers and business decision-makers. The focus on public-private partnership through the lens of US-China relations was a perfect match. Moreover, Dr. Chao Guo’s research on social entrepreneurship expanded my perspective on developing a public-private partnership with creating social values in mind.”\nLearn more about the I-MPA’s intensive and exciting coursework >\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nLooking for financial assistance?\n\n\n\nLearn about the options available to international and domestic students.\n\n\n\nSee financial aid »\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nMeet the faculty\n\n\n\nLearn from the university's most celebrated scholars and the industry's leading minds.\n\n\n\nSee faculty bios »\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nCourse descriptions\n\n\n\nSee the courses and electives available to master's students.\n\n\n\nSee courses & curriculum »\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 5 Reasons to Pursue an I-MPA Degree\nLearn how Penn’s faculty and resources provide an exceptional graduate school experience.\nSee the top 5 reasons to apply\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact us\nInternational Master of Public Administration\n3440 Market St, Suite 100\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104-3335\n(215) 746-6229\nPenn-IMPA@sas.upenn.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3440 Market Street, Suite 100\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104-3335\n(215) 746-6229\nPenn-IMPA@sas.upenn.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2023 College of Liberal and Professional Studies at The University of Pennsylvania\nReport Accessibility Issues and Get Help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It also serves to promote academic and social interaction among graduate bioengineering students. Any person registered as a full-time or part-time graduate student in the Bioengineering Department (or in a combined graduate degree program when at least one of those degrees is offered by the Bioengineering Department) for any portion of an academic year is considered a member of GABE for that full academic year. GABE has a voting representative in the Graduate Group Committee and also participates in other committees with the faculty.Graduate bioengineering students are kept abreast of issues affecting different segments of the University through GABE’s ties with various graduate student governing bodies. Representatives for GSEG are elected at the beginning of the fall semester. GSEG (Graduate Student Engineering Group) is the graduate student governing body of the School of Engineering and Applied Science. GABE is provided funds by GSEG as well as the Bioengineering Department.GABE-sponsored social events are held throughout the year and include a picnic in the Fall to welcome incoming students, Halloween pumpkin carving, happy hours, intramurals, community service, the holiday party and many other events. Amongst GABE’s academic activities are organization of BE student/faculty luncheons on career-related issues and participation in interdepartmental seminars.GABE is also a useful source of information for first-year students on such matters as campus activities, University services, on-campus and off-campus housing, etc. This information is provided in GABE’s Guide for First Year BE Graduate Students. GABE meetings are held monthly year round.Follow us on Twitter(@PennGABE) and Instagram(penn.gabe) for up-to-date event information! Interested in applying for a Bioengineering graduate degree at Penn?Check out the PhD Admissions and Master's Admissions webpages for more information!

Our group generates ideas with and for Philadelphia math teachers. The CBMP website is designed to cultivate a community of math teachers interested in locally relevant curriculum by providing a place to find and share lesson plans and experiences.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Lesson Idea Portal!\nWe are excited to share our work, and invite you to join our professional learning community. The lessons on this site have been aligned with the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics (CCSSM) and are designed to be a resource to use along with any math curriculum. Although these lessons were developed to reflect the urban context of Philadelphia, they can easily be adapted for use in any locale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\tBrowse our Collection!\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur History\nCBMP began in the summer of 2009 with a group of middle school math teachers from Philadelphia and graduate students and faculty members at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education. After finding that the contexts used in the existing math curriculum were not familiar to the youth living in this urban community, we redesigned them to include settings and situations that were more relevant to the middle school students. The initial goal of the project was to develop materials that were engaging for students, relevant to their urban community, aligned to state standards, and infused with social justice goals.\nFounding members included teachers Kelley Collings and Suzanne Reimann, and graduate students Nina Hoe, Vivian Lim, Emily Magee, and Luke Reinke.\nOver time, the project became a professional learning community. Participants work together to adapt math lessons for the classroom, share their experiences and questions, and develop new lessons based on local contexts and their students' lived experiences. In addition to the lessons, we have presented and written about our work in several conferences and publications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Publication\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n Increasing Access to Mathematics through Locally Relevant Curriculum \n In K.

The Center and Program encompass faculty from more than 20 departments and schools at Penn, and provide vital opportunities and resources for research, learning, and practice in the areas of gender and sexuality.\nThe FQT Center and GSWS Program at the University of Pennsylvania are committed to cultivating a learning environment that values and prioritizes inclusion, equity, and diversity through research, teaching, advocacy, activism, and community engagement. \nGSWS at Penn is an inclusive space, committed to affirming students, staff, and faculty of all genders and identities, including trans and non-binary individuals. We endeavor to cultivate a community in which every person, regardless of gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, socio-economic status, ability, neurodiversity, nationality, documented status, religious views, or position within the institution, is respected. GSWS supports pedagogy with gender-inclusive language, an intersectional curriculum, and accessible classroom practices, and invites departments and centers that share these values to collaborate and cross list courses. \nPhiladelphia occupies the traditional homelands of the Lenni-Lenape. The FQT Center and GSWS at the University of Pennsylvania acknowledge and express gratitude to the indigenous people of this land, past and present, for the opportunity to live and learn on Lenapehoking, land of the Lenape.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nContact\nFisher-Bennett Hall3340 Walnut StreetSuite 345Philadelphia, PA 19104(215) 898-8740\ngsws-fqt@sas.upenn.edu\n \n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Co-Sponsorship\n \n\nMailing List Signup\n \n\nMake a Gift\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPenn WebLogin\n \n\n\n© 2023 The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\n\n\n \n\n",

In 1924, the Women’s Student Government Association at Penn began publication of a women’s student newspaper, The Bennett News. Grace Marie Haspel (B.S. in Ed., 1925) was the first Editor-in-Chief. This weekly paper went through twenty-three volumes before its name changed to The Pennsylvania News in the fall of 1947. The Pennsylvania News  continued to be published until the fall of 1964 when it produced its final issue.\nThis collection presently contains 1,097 issues comprising 4,825 pages and 36,874 articles. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured in this collection\n\n\n\nThe Bennett News 8 February 1945\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrowse the collection\n\nBrowse by date Browse by date\nBrowse tags Browse tags\n\nTop text correctors\n\n\n\n1.\njessdummer\n511\n\n\n2.\nEric Jacobs\n347\n\n\n3.\nNick S.\n230\n\n\n4.\nBenjamin C.

The ONR delivers a suite of services throughout the lifespan of a research project, from initial study development to grant closeout. The ONR also provides highly-skilled statistical support, guidance with regulatory compliance, and mock peer-review sessions. \nProposal Submission Process.  To provide equitable service to all members of the Penn Nursing community, all proposals must be registered using the link below at least 10 business days before the sponsor deadline. Investigators should complete this registration as soon as they believe they will submit an application. Only after completing the registration will a member of the ONR team be assigned to work with the investigator(s). Early and consistent communication between ONR and investigators is essential to the success of each submission. Toward that end, if the submission is not registered at least 10 business days before the sponsor’s deadline, the proposal will not be submitted until the next available due date. Additionally, all application materials must be in their final format/presentation in the designated shared-drive folder at least 5 business days before the sponsor’s deadline. Otherwise, the application will not be submitted until the next opportunity arises. This policy supports the development of high quality and timely submissions representative of Penn Nursing.\n\n\nLogin\n\n\nNew Proposal Submission\nBrowse Current Proposals\n\n\nProposal View\nONR View\n\n\nEverything View\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            © 2022 - OnrGrantsManager V1.0\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

According to Morris (1966), the type of task assigned to\nthe group explained 60% of the communication variance. Understanding\ntask characteristics has been called “a basic requirement” (Roby and\nLanzetta 1958) and a “high-priority research need” (Hackman 1968).\nBut often, in social science, the task simply acts a backdrop to\nother theoretical questions. The researcher simply “‘give[s] the subject\na task to do’ while some ‘substantive’ variables are being studied”\n(Hackman 1968) — then, based on the results, researchers use intuition\nto generalize the findings to other settings. However, the specific\nfeatures of tasks, and how they might influence the results of\nexperiments, are rarely quantified or analyzed in detail.\nIn fact, the tools to analyze the impact of task features\nhave not previously existed. The best way to describe a task\nhas, historically, been using frameworks that place tasks into\nconceptual categories, such as “creative tasks” (e.g. McGrath 1984) or\n“maximizing tasks” (e.g., Steiner 1972). The problem is that these\nframeworks have incompatible underlying assumptions, and so different\nways of grouping tasks are not comparable to one another. Additionally,\nusing these conceptual categories places the onus on the researcher to\nmake subjective judgments, which can vary from person to person —\nparticularly because terms within task frameworks are not always\noperationally well-defined.\n\n\nWe quantify task features, so that researchers can use them to\nsample tasks intelligently and build task-sensitive theories.\nWe allow researchers to answer the question, “how might the features\nof the task I am using affect the generalizability of my results?” and,\n“how can I design future experiments to ensure that my findings are as\ngeneralizable as possible?”\nSpecifically, we define a “design space” of tasks (the Task Space),\nshown in the figure below. By quantifying the features of 102\ntasks across 24 dimensions, each on a 0-1\nscale, researchers can use task features to intelligently select tasks\n(ensuring, for example, that the tasks used in a study are as diverse as\npossible), as well as include task features in empirical analysis, such\nas mediation, moderation, meta-analysis, and more.\n\n\nAn illustration of the Task Space. The space can\nbe represented as a matrix (Left), in which each row represents a\ndifferent task, and each column represents a different task dimension.\nEach row, or task vector, can then be conceptualized as a point in a\nmultidimensional space (Right).\n\nThe process by which we quantify these features is described in more\ndetail in our (forthcoming) paper — stay tuned!\nA more user-friendly version of the Task Space is to project it into\ntwo dimensions using PCA — producing a “map” of tasks, or the Task Map.\nTo familiarize yourself with the Task Map, please feel free to play with\nthe interactive visualizer below. You can choose different values of\nk, and the visualizer will conduct k-means clustering on the\nfull, underlying 24-dimensional space. You can mouse over each dot to\nsee the name of the task.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Task Map\n\nSelect Tasks\nOne way the Task Map can potentially help you is by making it easier\nfor you to select tasks for experiments. Rather than arbitrarily\nchoosing tasks for experiments, the Task Map makes it possible to define\nspecific algorithms for task selection, which can then be reproduced\neasily by other researchers.\nThese include:\n\nSelecting Maximally Different (Diverse) Tasks.\nThe researcher may wish to cast the net as wide as possible, choosing\ntasks that represent a diverse array of activities (i.e., that maximizes\nthe within-group difference of the chosen tasks, and thus makes it more\nlikely that a finding will generalize across many activities). Such a\nset of tasks is shown in in the figure below by the red points.\nSelecting Minimally Different (Similar) Tasks.\nAlternatively, a researcher may be interested in a cluster of tasks with\nsimilar properties. Perhaps they are concerned about a specific\nphenomenon — for example, memory — and wish to select only tasks from a\nlimited region in the Task Space (e.g., Recall Images, Recall Words, and\nRecall Stories). Such a set of tasks is shown in the figure below by the\nblue points.\nAdaptive Sampling. The researcher may not wish\nto pre-select all tasks, and may instead opt for an adaptive approach in\nwhich each subsequent task is chosen based on the results of the\nprevious task. Here, they can use an active learning algorithm (for\nexample, Bayesian optimization). Using an uncertainty sampling approach,\nthe algorithm might identify a region of tasks about which it currently\nhas the least information and suggest subsequent experiments to reduce\nits uncertainty. The researcher would thus progressively gain more\nknowledge by repeatedly prodding at their theory’s boundary\nconditions.\n\n\nSample Code for Sampling Tasks\nThe red and blue tasks in the figure below were generated by this\nPython notebook, which you can use as a starting point for selecting\ntasks. More generally, you can download the Task Space and implementing\nany selection algorithm that works for you.\n\n\nIn Red: 10 tasks that were selected to be as\ndifferent as possible using a Euclidean distance metric; In Blue: 10\ntasks that were selected to be as similar as possible using a Euclidean\ndistance metric.\n\n\n\n\nBuild Models\nAnother way the Task Map can potentially help you is by providing you\nwith quantified task features, which can be used in data analysis. You\ncould, for example, statistically “control for” task features by\nincluding the feature columns in any other statistical model you are\nbuilding. Alternatively, you may be interested in comparing and\ncontrasting results across multiple different tasks, and building a\n“task-sensitive theory” for how behaviors shift as the task context\nshifts. Below is an example of such a task-sensitive theory, in which\nthe researcher fits a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to hypothetical data\nmeasuring the team outcome of “synergy.” After fitting the model on the\nTask Space, the researche can hypothesize that they will observe synergy\nfor teams completing tasks in the blue region, but will not observe\nsynergy for teams completing tasks in the red region.\n\n\nA Support Vector Machine, trained on all 24 task\ndimensions, can be used to predict a team outcome (for example, whether\nteams display “synergy” or not) for a given task. (Here, the synergy\nlabels are synthetic, while the task points are real.) The green points\nwith white labels represent 10 tasks used in the researcher’s\nexperiment. For these 10 tasks, teams displayed synergy for some\n(synergy = 1, represented by a triangle), and did not display synergy\nfor others (synergy = 0, represented by a circle). The SVM predicts that\nteams performing tasks in the blue region will display synergy, while\nteams performing tasks in the red region will not display synergy. The\nlower panel shows the top 10 weights for the SVM. Tasks in the positive\nclass tend to have greater weight in the Mixed-Motive, Conflicting\nTradeoffs, Solution Scheme Outcome Uncertainty, Cognitive Conflict, and\nGenerate dimensions. Tasks in the negative class tend to have greater\nweight in the Outcome Multiplicity, Objective Correctness, Optimizing,\nDecision Verifiability, and Divisible-Unitary dimensions.\n\nThe underlying support vector machine used for this example was\ngenerated using this\nPython notebook.\n\n\nDownload the Data\nYou can use the Task Space today, by downloading it here: task_map.csv.\nThis data is updated periodically with new tasks, ratings, and columns,\nas appropriate.\nIf you are curious about the specific descriptions of each class, we\nalso provide an augmented\nversion of the data, with an additional column called html\nthat details the specific task description. Additionally, we\ndocument all of the questions used to generate the tasks here.\n\n\nContribute your own tasks / dimensions!\nWe welcome efforts to continue expanding our Task Space.

Each graduate program has a separate admissions process. Applicants apply directly to the program of interest. All questions about the admissions process should be directed to the program of interest.\nSpring 2020\nRecognizing the challenges of teaching, learning, and assessing academic performance during the global COVID-19 pandemic, Penn’s admissions committees for graduate and professional programs will take the significant disruptions of the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 into account when reviewing students’ transcripts and other admissions materials as part of their regular practice of performing individualized, holistic reviews of each applicant. In particular, as we review applications now and in the future, we will respect decisions regarding the adoption of Pass/Fail and other grading options during the period of COVID-19 disruptions. An applicant will not be adversely affected in the admissions process if their academic institution implemented a mandatory pass/fail (or similar) system for the term or if the applicant chose to participate in an optional pass/fail (or similar) system for the term. Penn’s longstanding commitment remains to admit graduate and professional student cohorts composed of outstanding individuals who demonstrate the resilience and aptitude to succeed in their academic pursuits.\nRequired Tests\nFor PhD applicants: Most, but not all, PhD programs at Penn require the Graduate Record Examination (GRE). The University’s institution code is 2926, you only need to send your scores to one Penn code and it will be matched to your application. Each graduate program has a different GRE requirement; please refer to your program of interest for more information. For information about the administration of the GRE, see the Educational Testing Service website.\nFor professional program applicants: Some, but not all, professional programs at Penn require standardized test scores, such as the GRE, LSAT, MCAT, GMAT, etc. Each program has a different requirement and a different institution code. Please refer to your program of interest for more information. \nInternational Applicants\nApplicants who are non-native English speakers may also be required to report scores from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), Pearson’s PTE Academic, or International English Language Testing System (IELTS). Please refer to your program of interest for detailed requirements.\nPenn is a leader among its peers in welcoming students from every part of the world. The division of International Student and Scholar Services offers help, advice, and information on all matters connected to immigration, employment, adjustment to a new culture, and living in Philadelphia. \nApplication Materials\nPlease note that all application materials become property of the University of Pennsylvania and will not be returned. Remember to retain a personal copy of your application.\nOffline Recommendation\nPenn strongly prefers that recommenders submit letters of recommendation online through the admissions system. If, however, your recommender is unable to submit an online recommendation, please follow these instructions:\n1) Select the “Recommendation Form PDF Download” and download the form.\n2) Complete the first section.

Consult the individual schools and programs for details. Penn awards some loans based on financial need. These awarded loans are only made by Penn as part of a student’s financial aid package. The loans are repayable by the student after completion of his/her education or withdrawal from school and are not subsidized.\nStudents in Ph.D. programs generally receive multi-year financial packages to cover tuition, fees, health insurance and a living allowance or stipend. The terms of the award may vary according to field of study. Contact individual programs for details. Most programs require that PhD students teach or conduct research for two or more years during their course of study, as part of their academic preparation.\nPenn’s professional schools provide limited assistance in the form of grants based on financial need. Some schools award merit-based scholarships or provide support in return for service. Contact your school for information on its policies and application procedures for grants and scholarship funding.\nPenn’s Student Financial Services provides up-to-date information the cost of attendance, as well as loans and other resources for support. U.S. citizens and permanent residents may be eligible for federal loans (i.e., Direct Loan, Grad PLUS). In addition, private alternative loan programs are available for credit-worthy borrowers. Generally, international students must have a qualified co-signer who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t  Grad Student Life\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA stimulating intellectual and social community of students and scholars from across Penn’s 12 schools form a vibrant graduate network.

New graduate and professional students are encouraged to start looking for housing 3-4 months before arriving at Penn. Each spring, the University offers online sessions about housing so that incoming graduate students can get this critical information before arriving on campus. \nThe Graduate Student Center's Resources for New Grad Students includes a section on Moving to Philadelphia, which includes more information on transportation, parking, dining, and more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n122 College Hall\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104\n215-898-5000\nprovost@upenn.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n©2023 University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104 \n\n\nFooter Menu\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\n\nPenn Directory\n\n\nSite Credits\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Linguistics is also concerned with how languages are learned and used, how they vary and change, and the relationship of language to cognition, biology, and society.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Department of Linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania has a longstanding reputation for using diverse kinds of empirical data to advance linguistic theory. Known for its interdisciplinary research, the department not only spans the subfields of linguistics but also connects with many other fields in cognitive science and beyond.

        "Penn CS Theory Group | Penn CS Theory GroupPenn CS Theory GroupPeopleTheory Seminar SchedulePenn CS Theory GroupTheoretical computer science (TCS) looks at the computational universe around us through the lens of mathematics. The span of problems in TCS include both the design of new models for computational problems as well as the study of efficient algorithms (and computational complexity) for various tasks in well established models. In addition to being central to computer science, in recent decades, TCS has forged strong connections with several areas including biology, economics, physics and law.The Theory Group at Penn has world-renowned researchers working on core areas of algorithms and complexity as well as applications to areas including algorithmic fairness, cryptography, computational biology, databases, game theory and data privacy.Recent EventsTheory Seminar: Mordecai GolinThe speaker for this week’s theory seminar is Mordecai Golin from HKUST. As usual, the talk will take place on Friday 5/5 at 1PM in Levine 307.\nTitle: AIFV-m Coding and Finding the Cheapest Markov Chain Mordecai Golin. Hong Kong UST\nAbstract: Binary AIFV-m codes are a relatively new method for lossless compression. They encode using an m-tuple of coding trees rather than the single tree used by Huffman coding. Their advantage is better proven redundancy than Huffman codes; their disadvantage is a slight decoding delay.Read Full AbstractTheory Seminar: Sergei VassilvitskiiThe speaker for the theory seminar on 4/28 is Sergei Vassilvitskii from Google. As usual, the talk will take place at 1pm in Levine 307.\nTitle: New advances in ‘Algorithms with Predictions’\nAbstract: The theoretical study of algorithms and data structures has been bolstered by worst-case analysis, where we prove bounds on the running time, space, approximation ratio, competitive ratio, or other measure that holds even in the worst case. In practice, however, we often do not face worst-case scenarios, and the question arises of how we can tune our algorithms to work even better on the kinds of instances we are likely to see, while ideally keeping a rigorous formal framework similar to what we have developed through worst-case analysis.Read Full AbstractMoreTheory Seminar: Abhishek ShettyTheory Seminar: Xi ChenTheory Seminar: Rajesh JayaramTheory Seminar: Zihan TanAll Events",

We seek to improve the quality and productivity of enterprises through the training of our students and a better understanding of operational strategies, product development and innovation, information systems and technology, rigorous data analytics, and individual and managerial decision making.\nWe utilize a diverse set of research methods, including theoretical models, laboratory studies and empirical analysis of field data, but in all cases we are data driven and grounded in science-based management.\nWe view education as central to our mission and we offer a diverse slate of courses in all three major degree programs at Wharton (Undergraduate, MBA and PhD). In each course we strive to deliver relevant content in an effective and compelling manner with the objective to train our students to become successful managers or research scholars. To that end, because we are highly inter-disciplinary, our undergraduate and MBA students have gone on to successful careers in start-up and established firms in managerial consulting, finance, marketing, operations management, and information technology management and our PhD students have received academic appointments in the top institutions throughout the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Faculty\n\n\nRebecca Schaumberg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA business journal from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcademics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUndergraduate\n\n\nProgram Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMBA\n\n\nProgram Information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhD\n\n\nProgram Information\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Additional Links \n\n\nOperations, Information and Decisions Department Home\nFaculty\nResearch\nPrograms\nDepartment Information\nFind an Expert\n\n\n\nPrograms\nUndergraduate\nMBA\nEMBA\nDoctorate\nExecutive Education\nWharton Online\n\n\nLocations\nPhiladelphia\nSan Francisco\nBeijing\n\n\nThe Power of Wharton\nGlobal Influence\nAnalytics\nEntrepreneurship & Innovation\n\n\nFeatured\nGive to Wharton\nAlumni\nKnowledge@Wharton\nRecruiters & Corporations\n\n\nWharton\nFaculty\nAbout Us\nResearch Centers\nDepartments\n\n\nResources\nContact Us\nNews\nFaculty & Staff\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitterFacebookLinkedInYouTubeInstagramSupport Wharton©2023 The Wharton School,  The University of Pennsylvania  |  Operations, Information and Decisions Department  |  Privacy Policy  |  Report Accessibility Issues and Get Help \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Stephenson Foundation Educational Laboratory & Bio-MakerSpace, located in 225 Skirkanich Hall, is the primary teaching lab for the Department of Bioengineering at Penn Engineering. By combining Bioengineering's educational lab space with an open MakerSpace, we encourage a free flow of ideas, creativity, and entrepreneurship between Bioengineering students and students throughout Penn.This interdisciplinary lab is a Bio-MakerSpace (aka BioMakerSpace or BioMaker Space) with over 50 unique pieces of equipment and over 500 unique supplies available for molecular biology work, human and animal physiology studies, chemistry, and microfluidics; Instron test systems for mechanical testing; electrical/electronic test and prototyping equipment; and mechanical prototyping equipment, including a sewing machine, 3-D Printers, and a laser cutter.We are the only Bio-MakerSpace at Penn and in the Philadelphia area, and are open to all Penn students for personal projects as well as coursework. Access to the lab assumes acceptance of all lab policies and safety rules. Learn more about the lab in our American Society for Engineering Education paper.Lab courses are heavily project based, and students learn modeling, analysis, and design techniques involving physiological studies, instrumentation and circuit design, medical device development, biomechanics, biomaterials, microfluidics, and cell engineering.

Wilson, MD, PhD, reflects on 10 years of leading Penn’s Orphan Disease Center.\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States, orphan diseases represent a collection of disorders that afflict fewer than 200,000 individuals for any single disease type. There are more than 7,000 distinct orphan diseases.\nIn the aggregate, over 25 million people in the United States suffer substantial morbidity and mortality from orphan diseases. Despite this huge number, research in most disease types has lagged far behind other major areas due to a combination of technological and funding limitations.The Orphan Disease Center of the University of Pennsylvania exists to facilitate and fund research, and develop transformative therapies for rare diseases with significant unmet need.  \n\n\n\n\n\nWe aim to make rare disease research accessible, collaborative, and sustainable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrograms & Initiatives\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrant OpportunitiesThe ODC offers over 50 grant opportunities in 30+ disease areas annually to researchers across the globe, as well as within the Penn and CHOP community. Since 2011, our grant programs have funded $37.6 million in rare disease research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJumpStartThe JumpStart program serves to establish and progress research agendas in emerging and neglected rare diseases.

To that end, several of the more predictable aspects of applying to dental schools have changed and created some questions from our applicants and advisors that are somewhat universal and we address here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Prerequisite Course Requirements                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPenn Dental Medicine seeks DMD applicants with a broad and strong educational background, who will have completed a four-year degree program prior to matriculation. While a foundation in science is desirable preparation for dental school, well-prepared candidates also possess course work in humanities, social science, and the arts. Non-science majors are encouraged to apply. Preference is given to those who have completed upper division science courses beyond the minimum requirements.\nApplicants may apply to our program prior to the completion of predental requirements or other course work. All prerequisite courses should be completed by the spring term, prior to matriculation to dental school. Although there is no expiration date for prerequisite courses, applicants should consider new additional course work to reinforce any knowledge gained previously.\nAP/IB Credit: Advanced Placement (AP) and International Baccalaureate (IB) course work can be credited towards predental requirements as long as the credit appears on an official college transcript.\nPASS/FAIL: All prerequisite courses must be completed for a letter grade with the following exception. Penn Dental Medicine will accept P/F grades for prerequisite courses completed during the spring, summer, and fall 2020 and 2021 terms to fulfill admissions requirements as a result of the COVID Pandemic.\nONLINE COURSES: Penn Dental Medicine prefers that prerequisite coursework be completed in a traditional classroom setting. Prerequisite courses completed online will be evaluated in the context of your entire academic record. Penn Dental Medicine will accept online prerequisite courses completed during the spring, summer, and fall 2020 and 2021 terms to fulfill admissions requirements as a result of the COVID Pandemic.\n\nGeneral Biology – Two semesters /three quarters of general biology with corresponding lab.

Focused exposure in general dentistry is expected prior to submission of your AADSAS application. This may occur in one or more general dental practices. In order to explore the breadth of the dental profession, further exploration in the dental specialties, while not required, is recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Selection Factors                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPenn Dental Medicine seeks students who will advance the profession and gives preference to those who demonstrate a commitment to any of the following: excellence and leadership as demonstrated among others through extracurricular activities, community service; exposure to the dental profession through activities including but not limited to in-person observation, review of dental procedures online or attending dental related informational programs through pre-dental organizations; research experience as well as academic preparation.\nAlthough there is no minimum grade-point average or Dental Admission Test (DAT) score requirement, special consideration will be given to candidates with overall and science grade point averages of 3.2 or higher. We seek students who will be successful in our demanding curriculum due to solid academic preparation, the flexibility to adapt to changing technologies, and the interpersonal skills to interact with diverse populations. Grades and DAT scores are only part of the review process and viewed in the context of the entire application.\nThe Office of Student Admissions at Penn Dental Medicine is excited to recruit the most motivated, engaged, diverse, and compassionate individuals to our program. Our students advance the profession through leadership, academic achievements, community and campus involvement, participation in research, participation in the arts or in sports, and pre-dental activities among their many qualities and accomplishments that they bring to our School.\nPenn Dental Medicine students are as diverse in their backgrounds as they are in their interests. As a private school we seek to enroll individual from all 50 states and many countries and our student body reflects that. Through our many student organizations such as SNDA, HSDA, ISDA, Penn Pride, Penn Firsts, all students find homes within our Penn Dental Medicine community in which they prosper. Penn Dental Medicine feels strongly about the need for the most diverse health care teams and through its enrollment of an enriched student body advances that objective directly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Application Procedures                        \n\n\n\n\n\nPenn Dental Medicine participates in the Associated American Dental Schools Application Service (AADSAS), a centralized application service sponsored by the American Dental Education Association (ADEA). The AADSAS application must be completed via the ADEA web site, www.adea.org. For more information regarding this application, contact: ADEA / AADSAS, P.O. Box 9110, Watertown, MA 02471, e-mail: aadsasinfo@aadsasweb.org, or phone: 617-612-2045 (applicant inquiries only).\nApplication Deadline: December 1, 2023\nNote: Due to the large number of applicants (2,542 for the class entering August 2023), it is highly recommended that candidates apply well in advance of the December 1 deadline date. Incomplete applications will not be considered. Although the majority of the PDM applicant pool submit applications by September 1, all applications completed by the deadline date will be reviewed for interview consideration. Decisions to review late applications are at the discretion of the Admissions Selection Committee. All application materials and documents become the property of Penn Dental Medicine and will not be returned to the applicant.\nThe following documents must be submitted along with the AADSAS application to the application service:\n\nDental Admission Test (DAT) Scores — Applicants must submit DAT scores by the December 1 deadline. Scores reported through ADEA AADSAS are considered official. DAT scores from test dates starting January 2021 and later are required for admission. The Admissions Committee may invite applicants to interview based upon academic preparation, pre-dental experience, extracurricular activities, work experience and/or research prior to the receipt of official DAT scores.\n\n\nLetters of Evaluation — A minimum of two letters from professors (preferably from your major course of study) or a committee letter prepared by the school’s prehealth advisor and/or a committee familiar with the applicant’s academic abilities is required. Penn Dental Medicine does not require letters from science faculty, unless you are a science major. Letters should be on letterhead and include a signature and title. Please refer to the AADSAS application instructions for submitting letters of evaluation.\n\n\nOfficial Transcripts — All applicants must submit official transcripts to the AADSAS application service for verification. AADSAS applications will not be processed and sent to the individual schools until transcripts are received and verified. The Penn Dental Medicine Admissions Office requires official transcripts only from candidates who have been accepted for admission. Please do not forward transcripts to Penn Dental Medicine’s Office of Student Admissions until notified to do so.\n\nIt is recommended that applicants submit the Penn Dental Supplemental Application and application fee as soon as possible after submitting the AADSAS Application. In addition to the AADSAS application, applicants are required to complete and submit the following documents to Penn Dental Medicine for interview consideration.\n\nSupplemental Application for Admission – Upon submission and verification of the AADSAS application all applicants will be invited to complete our Supplemental Application via the Penn Dental Medicine applicant portal.\nApplication Fee – A $60 non-refundable application fee must be submitted directly to the Penn Dental Medicine Office of Student Admissions. You may pay the application fee electronically via the Penn Dental Medicine applicant portal. No application fee waivers are available.\n\nOnly complete applications will receive consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Canadian Applicants                        \n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the U.S. DAT is preferred, Canadian citizens and residents may submit Canadian DAT scores. Applicants who submit November CDAT test results reduce consideration due to test results arriving after the December 1 application deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                International Applicants                        \n\n\n\n\n\nCourse work from students who complete their degrees in countries other than the U.S. and Canada will be considered provided they include the foreign course work on their AADSAS applications. In addition, translated transcripts from ECE transcript service must be submitted to the Penn Dental Medicine Admissions Office in order to review the student’s academic performance. Although international students are not required to meet their minimum course prerequisites at a U.S. educational institution, preference will be given to those who have taken some course work in the U.S. TOEFL scores are not required for admission to the four-year predoctoral program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Transfer Students                        \n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, Penn Dental Medicine is not considering transfer applications into the DMD program.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                The Admissions Process                        \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Admissions Selection Committee begins reviewing applications in July. Selected applicants will be invited for an interview day based upon information from the AADSAS application, the Penn Dental Medicine Supplemental Application for Admission, and letters of evaluation. Interviews (by invitation only) are held weekly from September through March. In accordance with ADEA notification guidelines, the Admissions Selection Committee will issue acceptances on a rolling basis beginning December 15, until the class reaches capacity. Accepted candidates are obliged to make a deposit of $1,000 to an offer of admission within the following schedule:\n\n30 days after notification if received on or after 12/15\n30 days after notification if received on or after 1/1\n15 days after notification if received on or after 2/1\n10 days after notification if received on or after 3/1*\n\nAn additional deposit of $1,000 is due on March 1 to continue to reserve a place in the class entering in August. Both deposits are non-refundable and are credited toward the first semester tuition payment.\n*Candidates accepted on or after March 1 are obligated to make one deposit totaling $2,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Notification                        \n\n\n\n\n\nApplicants will be notified of status changes via email and the Penn Dental Medicine applicant portal. Interview invitations will be emailed beginning in August and will continue through February on a rolling basis. Acceptance notification will begin December 15 on a rolling basis until the class reaches capacity. Unsuccessful applicants will be notified beginning October until completion of the admissions cycle. It is highly recommended that applicants update the ADEA AADSAS web portal with changes to their contact information as soon as they occur. Currently, the Office of Student Admissions does not update the ADEA AADSAS web portal with status changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Matriculation Requirements                        \n\n\n\n\n\nCriminal Background Checks – All matriculating students are required to complete a criminal background check prior to matriculation. It is possible that infractions as a result of a background check could prevent an accepted applicant from matriculating at Penn Dental Medicine. Please note that professional licensure requirements may prohibit individuals with criminal convictions from ultimately obtaining a professional license. Licensure requirements vary by state. Prospective students are encouraged to consult state licensing agencies for more information.\nHealth and Immunization Requirements – All admitted students must meet The University of Pennsylvania and Penn Dental Medicine’s health and immunization requirements prior to matriculation. Matriculating students will be asked to provide Student Health Services and Penn Dental Medicine with proof of immunizations prior to matriculation. Students must remain in compliance for the duration of their enrollment at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                Contact Information                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice of Admissions\nRobert Schattner Center\nUniversity of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine\n240 South 40th Street, Room 122\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104-6030\nTelephone: 215-898-8943 (M-F 9 a.m. – 4:30 p.m.)\nFax: 215-573-9648\ndental-admissions@dental.upenn.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdmissions & Academics\nDMD ProgramAdmissionsDMD CurriculumClinical EducationCommunity Outreach / Service LearningHonors ProgramDual-Degree OptionsLeonard Davis Institute Summer Research FellowshipTuition & FeesProspective Student Learning OpportunitiesGraduate Dental Education ProgramsAdvanced Graduate Degree ProgramsProgram for Advanced Standing StudentsBio-Dental Consortial Programs for High School StudentsFinancial AidTechnical & Health StandardsOffice of Faculty Diversity & MentorshipAcademic Calendar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                Interested in attending Penn Dental Medicine?

An investigational vaccine is a vaccine that is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for use outside of this study. The FDA is the health authority that gives approval for new vaccines for use in the United States.This research study will test different dose levels to determine the dose level that is best tolerated and safe in healthy human participants and then use that dose level to collect more information about the safety and tolerability of BNT163. The vaccine being tested in this study is a vaccine that is being developed for the prevention of genital herpes lesions caused by HSV-2 (herpes simplex 2) and possibly HSV-1 (herpes simplex 1). This study is the first time it will be tested in humans.\n                                    \n                            \n\n\n\n                            Learn More\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Screening Protocol for Affected and Unaffected Participants in Studies of Alcohol Use Disorder.\n                                    \n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        18-75  years\n        \n\n\n\n\n    Healthy Volunteer\n  \n\n\n\n\n          All genders\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                    \n                                        The\ngoal is to conduct a screening procedure to be used in evaluating individuals\neither with or without an alcohol use disorder (AUD) to determine whether it is\nsafe and appropriate for them to participate in a clinical trial, imaging\nstudy, genetic study, or other research protocol that matches their interests and\neligibility.

Although data from the Uniform Crime Reports are complete only though 2020, local data that now are available suggest that in many areas of the country, violent crime increases have continued into 2022. There also have been several recent mass shootings, defined by four or more deaths from a single shooting incident. Mass shootings account for a tiny fraction of all homicides but add dramatically to the visibility of gun violence. \nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a Mass Shooting? What can be done? \nOn Saturday night, June 4th, 15 people were shot while enjoying a night out on the 200 block of South Street in Philadelphia. Restaurants, bars, and entertainment venues had drawn large crowds when a fight broke out, and shots were fired. Eleven people were wounded. Three were killed. Because of the large number of revelers and an earlier incident, many police officers already had been patrolling near by. As the shooting began, some bystanders drew their handguns. It is not clear whether they fired any shots.\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n Do Russian Police Fabricate Drug Offenses? Evidence From Seized Heroin's Weight Distribution\nCurrent Russian drug policy is punitive toward people who use drugs. Moreover, criminal justice in Russia is driven by strong organizational incentives to increase performance indicators of police such as clearance rate. Taken together, these might lead to the use of extrajudicial and illegal police practices, as documented by several qualitative studies. In this article, we explore quantitative evidence of such practices, namely, weight anomalies of the seized heroin that result from minimum threshold amounts established by the law.\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Legal Regulation of the Police Impact Crime?\nIn the past few years, the topic of police reform, and the role of legal interventions by the courts has been discussed by politicians and covered extensively in the media. One of the more intrusive forms of court interventions is the use of a consent decree – a settlement agreement filed in federal court between plaintiffs and the local government agency in charge of the police. Typically consent decrees are overseen by a judge, who can legally enforce provisions in the agreement.   \nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\nCan One Believe Forensic Evidence?\n(Updated 9-11-2017)\nThe several television programs under the CSI (Crime Scene Investigation) brand are crime dramas depicting how sophisticated forensic tools are used to solve cases. Because such tools are based on science, they are only as good as the science on which they rest. How good is the science? As the references listed below make plain, much of the forensics depicted in television programs is at best fanciful, and real-life forensics are too often not much better.\n \nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n‹\n›\n\n\n    More Fact Checking →  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews/In the Media\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n 60-Second Lecture: \"Big Data and Policing\" \n May 2, 2023 \n\n March 18th, Richard Berk gives invited talk on homelessness at UCLA Department of Statistics \n March 28, 2023 \n\n Despite lower crime rates in 2020, risk of victimization grew \n November 10, 2022 \n\n Crime thrives, disparities grow where there is \"concentrated disadvantage\" \n November 1, 2022 \n \n\n\n    More »  \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nWorking Papers\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n Courts \n\n Crime \n\n Police \n\n Prison \n\n Probation and Parole \n\n Research Methods \n\n Other \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Video Content\n\n\n  \nMaria Cuellar Talks at the Royal Statistical Society Conference\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Information\n558 McNeil Building3718 Locust WalkPhiladelphia, PA 19104-6286(215) 573-9097crim-info@sas.upenn.edu\n \n\nPenn WebLogin\n \n\n\n© 2023 The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\n\n\n \n\n\n",

The American Nurses Association (ANA) called racism “a public health crisis,” while the American Association of Colleges of Nursing declared that “racism will no longer be tolerated.” In fact, since its inception, organized nursing has not only tolerated racism but also actively practiced it, while those who have provided the field with both evidence and opportunity to make antiracist change have found themselves facing the weaponized inertia of the institutions which claim to represent them.\nRead more at: https://nursingclio.org/2020/10/29/marie-branch-and-the-power-of-nursing/\n\nShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading... \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPosted in Uncategorized \n | \nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Racist Lady With The Lamp\n\n\n\t\t\tPosted on November 12, 2020 by Barbara Bates Center for the Study of the History of Nursing \n\n\nNatalie Stake-Doucet, RN, MSC, Doctoral Candidate, Université de Montréal\nThe following is an excerpt of a recent post by Natalie Stake-Doucet, on Nursing Clio.\n \n\nNursing historiography is centered on whiteness. Even worse, nursing history revolves largely around a single white nurse: Florence Nightingale. This, unfortunately, doesn’t mean nurses understand who Nightingale was. There are nurse historians doing incredible and diverse work, but in general, nursing, both as a profession and as an academic discipline, promotes a view of Nightingale based in a culture of white supremacy rather than historical facts. Here, I make explicit Nightingale’s role in British colonial violence by analyzing some of her writings on the British colonies. This history allows us to better discuss the consequences of her legacy in nursing.\nRead more at: https://nursingclio.org/2020/11/05/the-racist-lady-with-the-lamp/\nShare this:Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Reddit (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pocket (Opens in new window)Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to email a link to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window)Like this:Like Loading... \n\n\n\t\t\t\tPosted in Guest Post \n | \nLeave a comment\n\n\n\n\n\n1918 Redux: Supportive Nursing Care for the Coronavirus Pandemic Is Courageous Care\n\n\n\t\t\tPosted on March 18, 2020 by Barbara Bates Center for the Study of the History of Nursing \n\n\nPatricia D’Antonio, PhD, RN, FAAN,  University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing\nThe following is an excerpt from a recent guest post by Barbara Bates Center Director Patricia D’Antonio, PhD, RN, FAAN, on Off the Charts, the blog of the American Journal of Nursing\n\nThe lessons of the past.\nAs we struggle to make sense of unfolding data, announcements, and public health directives about the current coronavirus pandemic, appreciating the lessons from past pandemics can help us understand the effectiveness and challenges related to quarantines and social isolation, as well as the need for reliable and timely communications.\nIn times of public health uncertainty, nurses and nursing care have played a critical role in saving lives and relieving suffering.

This situation continues to play out across the country with numerous news stories highlighting the contemporary heroin problem.

Johnson’s talent was delivery of a monologue about her experience caring for Joe, a patient with Alzheimer ’s disease. In a competition where the majority of contestants choose to enact a song or dance, Johnson’s performance stood out as unique. But it was comments made about Johnson’s monologue the following day by the co-hosts of ABC’s The View which hurled Johnson, and the nursing profession, into the public spotlight.

We believe this is an area of teacher knowledge and ability that is not well understood or developed in teacher education or professional development, but is central to what teachers do on a daily basis. It is our view that understanding and improving curriculum use is critical to improving teaching at scale.\nThe ICUBiT project is directed by Janine Remillard (Penn) and Ok-Kyeong Kim (WMU) and is run by a team of researchers at Western Michigan University and the University of Pennsylvania. We are guided by an expert team of advisors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Nos. 091841 and 0918126.

Students in the program can expect to complete two degrees in four years, a BA in a life sciences major through the College of Arts & Sciences, and a BSE in management through the Wharton business school. A watchword of the program is learning by doing. Students learn to apply and integrate the knowledge and skills they gain through direct practical experience both within and beyond the classroom. This they do by joining a supportive community of students, alumni and senior professionals all of whom are interested and invested in the transformative potential of the biosciences when implemented shrewdly.

Covered languages are American English, Canadian French, Egyptian Arabic, Farsi, German, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, Tamil and Vietnamese. For English, Mandarin and Spanish, the collection includes two distinct dialects. Participants could speak with a person of their choice on any topic; most called family members and friends. All calls originated in North America. This speech data was the foundation for NIST’s Language Recognition Evaluations conducted from 1996-2007. The first editions of the CALLFRIEND series published in LDC’s Catalog in 1996 contain 60 calls evenly split into 20 calls each for a training  partition to develop language models, a development partition for parameter tuning, and an evaluation partition to test performance (Torres-Carrasquillo, et al., 2004). Beginning in 2014, LDC released second editions for American English (LDC2019S21, LDC2020S08), Canadian French (LDC2019S18), Egyptian Arabic (LDC2019S04), Farsi (LDC2014S01), and Mandarin Chinese (LDC2018S09, LDC2020S06). The goal of the second editions is to facilitate continued widespread use of the data, specifically, by updating the audio files to .wav format, simplifying the directory structure, adding documentation and metadata, and combining the training, development and evaluation splits. CALLFRIEND Farsi Second Edition also includes additional telephone recordings and a separate transcripts release (LDC2014T01).In addition to work on language identification, CALLFRIEND corpora have been used in a variety of research tasks, including subject omission in Korean (Lee 2012), contemporary Persian vowels in casual speech (Jones 2019), Mandarin telephone closings among familiars (Huang, 2020), and adjective constructions in English conversation (Bybee & Thompson, 2021), among many others. To learn more about the CALLFRIEND collection or about other LDC corpora used for language identification research, search the Catalog by the “recommended application” and select “language identification” from the list.   \n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\nPrinter-friendly version\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nMembers\nCommunications\nLanguage Resources\nData Management\nCollaborations\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\nCatalog\nNew Corpora\nUser Login\nHow to Get Data\nLDC Submissions\nData Management Plans\nProjects\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   © 1992-2023  Linguistic Data Consortium, The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania.

Working at the intersection of social policy and practice and the fields of education, criminal justice, and environmental politics, the new faculty members listed below will deepen SP2’s expertise in inclusion and racial and economic justice. “We are thrilled to welcome Drs. DeMarcus Jenkins, Noor Toraif, and Alice Xu — three outstanding scholars and educators whose work crosses disciplinary boundaries to advance some of the most important conversations for our society,” says SP2 Dean Sara S. Bachman. “They are examining how spaces and institutions can be reimagined to address systemic oppression and promote inclusion for individuals and communities.” Read more at link in bio.[Image description: Square photos of DeMarcus Jenkins, Noor Toraif, and Alice Xu appear in a row against a dark blue background with \"SP2 welcomes three new faculty\" above and the Penn Social Policy & Practice logo below.] ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npennsp2\n\n\n\nView\n\n\n \n\n\n\n                        Jul 5\n\n\n\nOpen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClinical social worker and #PennSP2 alumna @JenniferUdler, MSW’97, is the author of Walk and Talk Therapy: A Clinician’s Guide to Incorporating Movement and Nature into Your Practice, published last month by @PESIPublishing.  In this #SP2AlumniSpotlight, Udler discusses her SP2 experience and her current work as founder of @positivestridestherapy, a practice that incorporates walking with talk therapy.  🔵 Why did you choose Penn and SP2? I loved the options to explore both micro and macro social work, as well as the internship opportunities.  🔵When did you first know that you wanted to be involved in social justice work? Why? In college, while noticing that not everyone has the same opportunities, and everyone can play a part in improving the world.  🔵What did you like most about your experience at SP2? What would you consider the key takeaways? Lively class discussions with very engaging classmates and enthusiastic professors. I think being involved in the greater Philadelphia community was instrumental in my professional development.  🔵What led you to your current position? Finding my strengths as a social worker and noticing the positive impact that I could have through providing individual therapy.  🔵What professional accomplishments have been the most meaningful to you, and why? Dedicating myself to learning as much as possible to better serve my clients. Being open minded, flexible, and learning new modalities. This has all led to my thriving Walk and Talk therapy practice. I am proud to say that I just published a book on the topic, hoping other social workers will feel confident taking their work outside.  🔵What are you looking forward to in your career? I`m looking forward to always learning more, and also sharing through writing and teaching.

During April through June of 2018, the Penn Social Norms Group (Penn SoNG) conducted focus groups together with a second wave of survey data collection to understand the social determinants of open defecation as well as surrounding collective practices in India.\n\nWe also included a complementary qualitative research component to assess relevant groups’ opinions, experiences, and challenges related to the collective practices we are studying. With these combined qualitative and quantitative data we now finally have the capacity to link social norms and social network data for the first time, allowing us to comprehensively analyze collective behaviors in the context of the networks in which they are embedded.\n\n\n \nWhy False Beliefs Drive Acceptance of Corruption\n\n\nPennSoNG Member Raj Patel explains the importance of measuring institutionalized corruption before testing as social norms to see what factors drive behavioral patterns. He talks about how surveying social norms can expose assumptions among individuals that certain behaviors are widely accepted, whereas in reality acceptance is low. Challenging these false beliefs can hugely improve the impact of collective action in changing behavior.\n\nRaj also outlines how societal change can happen quickly (within a single generation) because enough people’s values change at once or there is a realization that a majority within society feel the same way about certain behaviors. LINK TO THE VIDEO from Chatham House.\n\n\n \nFreedoms, Inequality and Social Change\n\n\nWe are excited to begin a new research project in the spring investigating the relationship between perceptions of inequality and perceptions of freedom. Our main hypothesis is that perceptions of freedom and autonomy shape perceptions of inequality, and vice versa. As people perceive themselves and others as having less autonomy/freedom – they also perceive greater inequality, especially inequality of opportunity. \nConversely, when people perceive themselves as having greater freedom, they also perceive less inequality and enhanced opportunity. A corollary of this hypothesis is that changes in perceived inequality over time affect people’s perception of autonomy such that perceptions of increasing inequality will further decrease perceptions of autonomy/freedom. Does perceiving an “inequality trajectory” affect our sense of autonomy/freedom? How much?\n\n\n \nChild Marriage and Malnutrition in Mali\n\n\nPenn SoNG members Sam Gant and Rachel Sander recently returned to Philadelphia from a three-week trip to Mali.  They are collaborating with UNICEF to research the social expectations and reference networks that maintain child marriage and malnutrition.\n\nIn February 2019, a SoNG-designed survey will be deployed to 6,000 respondents in two regions of the country.  Results of this survey will inform UNICEF’s national-level strategy for communications and collective behavioral change.  Final results are anticipated in June 2019.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Penn-UNICEF Partnership\nFrom 2010-2015, UNICEF staff from all over the world and from all backgrounds fly to Philadelphia to participate in our program.

The project focused on two key empirical questions: the roles of social interactions in (1) the acceptance (or rejection) of modern contraceptive methods and of smaller ideal family size; and (2) the diffusion of knowledge of AIDS symptoms and transmission mechanisms and the evaluation of acceptable strategies of protection against AIDS. This project is now complete and this website serves as an archive for this project. This project was formally listed as one of the five projects under the Social Networks Project. “The KDICP collaborated with Alan Ferguson of German Aid Agency GTZ and the MInistry of Health.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProudly powered by WordPress\n | \n\t\t\t\tTheme: Adaption by WordPress.com.\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to toolbar\n\nLog InSearch \n\n\n",

We constantly learn new things about the ancient Greek, Hellenistic, and Roman worlds, and their interactions with multiple other cultures. Our work is inherently interdisciplinary: we use historical, linguistic, literary and archaeological methods to understand ancient societies in their entirety. We celebrate opportunities for dialogue with colleagues in other fields, and with contemporary artists and writers.\nPremodern cultures were very different from any in the contemporary world. They can also seem similar, often in unexpected ways. In looking to the distant past, we are challenged to ask new questions about the present. Interpretations of the ancient past have shaped, and continue to shape, modern identities. We repudiate the uses of Greek and Roman antiquity in both scholarly and popular contexts as tools for oppression and exclusion. In our teaching, research and public engagement, we work for a more equitable and inclusive study of antiquity.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\nDeclare a Major or Minor\nLatin Placement\nPost-Baccalaureate Program\nDepartment Colloquium\nCalendar\nPenn Library Classical Studies Portal\nYouTube channel\nPenn Leiden Colloquia\nPenn Public Lectures on Classical Antiquity and the Contemporary World\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n7/18\n\nEmily Wilson writes about Homer translations in the NYT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6/29\n\nPenn Post-Baccalaureate 2023 Alumni Newsletter Published\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6/02\n\nKim Bowes’ and Cam Grey’s Roman Peasant Project is featured in Penn Omnia Magazine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6/01\n\nNick Brenner (C '23) wins the College Alumni Prize in Classics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6/01\n\nEmily Wilson publishes essay on Epictetus in the London Review of Books\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6/01\n\nGavin Blasdel (ANCH PhD '23): Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Groningen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther events of interest at Penn\n\nCenter for Ancient Studies\nUniversity Museum\nKislak Center, Penn Libraries\nMedieval/Renaissance Working Group\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment of Classical Studies, University of Pennsylvania, 201 Claudia Cohen Hall, 249 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104-6304\n 215-898-7425 / clst-info@sas.upenn.edu\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn WebLogin\n \n\n\n\n\n© 2023 The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Pilot funds are targeted to support small-scale, innovative, or exploratory projects with a duration of one year. Funded projects must have the potential to generate academic publications and priority will be given to projects with potential to develop small-scale or preliminary research findings that would lead to applications for extramural funding, especially to the National Institutes of Health. Total costs are generally limited to $10,000-$20,000 per application; however, larger budgets may be considered if the project is well-suited for generating applications for NIH funding.\nClick here to download the application materials and to read the RFP Guidelines.\nClick here to read about former and currently funded projects. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstitute on Aging\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPSC Quick Links\n\n\n\n\n\nIRB & Human Subjects \nNIH Public Access Policy \nPSC Library Catalog \nSociology Department \nEconomics Department \nDONATE TO THE PSC \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequest Services\n\n\n\n\n\nReserve the PSC Conference Room and/or Collaboration Space \nSubmit a Working Paper/Brief \nSubmit News & Events \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPARC About Us\n\n\n\n\nThe Population Aging Research Center (PARC) at the University of Pennsylvania has over 25 years of experience of creating the right setting for interdisciplinary research on the demography and economics of aging, including a focus on diverse and often underrepresented populations domestically and globally. The Population Aging Research Center (PARC) was established in 1994 with a grant from the National Institute on Aging. PARC sponsors an annual pilot proposal competition, a weekly seminar series in conjunction with the Population Studies Center, the Penn Population Studies Colloquium and an online working paper series, the Population Center Working Papers (PSC/PARC). The overall research themes of PARC reflect the interests and expertise of our research associates. These include: Health Care and Long-Term Care in Older Adults, Cognition and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD), Health Disparities in Aging, Early Life-Conditions and Older Adult Health, Behavior and Well-Being, and Global Aging and Health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact\n\n\nTel: 215-898-6441\n            Fax: 215-898-2124\n\n\n\n239 McNeil Building\n            3718 Locust Walk\n            Philadelphia, PA 19104-6298\n[Map & Directions]\n\n\n Contact Us\n twitter.com/pennparc\n  facebook.com/pennpsc\n  PARC Directory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Penn A-Z - Penn Calendar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn WebLogin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n © 2023  University of Pennsylvania\n\n\n Report Accessibility Issues and Get Help \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The planning process was a highly consultative one, involving extensive discussion among SAS faculty, students, staff, alumni, and volunteers, as well as with colleagues from other Penn schools and the University administration. Because of the planʼs emphasis on the central academic role of Arts and Sciences within Penn, we are eager to share our goals with the entire campus community and look forward to either continuing or launching the many cross-University academic partnerships described therein. We are excited about using this plan as a blueprint for achieving our highest priorities in the years ahead.\nSteven J.

Practicing high impact philanthropy starts with a social impact goal, then uses the best available evidence, considerations of cost and impact, and a commitment to ongoing learning to achieve that goal. It’s not about how much you give, but how well you give to drive positive, social change.\n\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews & Blogs\nThe Latest\n More News\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 24, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\nKat Rosqueta urges philanthropists to rethink the fundamentals in a new piece for Stanford Social Innovation Review\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 21, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\nKat Rosqueta discusses the philanthropic landscape in the year to come in CCS Fundraising's 2023 Philanthropy Pulse Webinar\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 20, 2023\t\t\t\t\t\nThree ways to respond following the earthquake in Turkey and Syria\n\n\n More News\n\n\n\n\n\n[The High Impact Giving Guide] is the single most useful guide to smart giving that I’ve come across since I began writing about philanthropy nearly two years ago.\n\n– Marc Gunther, Nonprofit Chronicles\n\n\n Read the Full Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Center for High Impact Philanthropy\n3815 Walnut Street\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104-6179 (Map)\nimpact@sp2.upenn.edu | 215-573-7266\n\n\n\nWho We Are\nWhat We Do\nGuidance by Issue\nEducation Programs\nNews & Events\nConnect with Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n \nDisclaimer\n|\nEmergency Services\n|\nPrivacy Policy\n|\nReport Accessibility Issues and Get Help\n|\nReport Copyright Infringement\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCopyright © 2023\t\t\t\t\tCenter for High Impact Philanthropy – University of Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The ONR delivers a suite of services throughout the lifespan of a research project, from initial study development to grant closeout. The ONR also provides highly-skilled statistical support, guidance with regulatory compliance, and mock peer-review sessions. \nProposal Submission Process.  To provide equitable service to all members of the Penn Nursing community, all proposals must be registered using the link below at least 10 business days before the sponsor deadline. Investigators should complete this registration as soon as they believe they will submit an application. Only after completing the registration will a member of the ONR team be assigned to work with the investigator(s). Early and consistent communication between ONR and investigators is essential to the success of each submission. Toward that end, if the submission is not registered at least 10 business days before the sponsor’s deadline, the proposal will not be submitted until the next available due date. Additionally, all application materials must be in their final format/presentation in the designated shared-drive folder at least 5 business days before the sponsor’s deadline. Otherwise, the application will not be submitted until the next opportunity arises. This policy supports the development of high quality and timely submissions representative of Penn Nursing.\n\n\nLogin\n\n\nNew Proposal Submission\nBrowse Current Proposals\n\n\nProposal View\nONR View\n\n\nEverything View\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n            © 2022 - OnrGrantsManager V1.0\r\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Most of them had been unjustly pronounced guilty of prostitution.  This interactive map makes it possible to learn who they really were and where they lived in New Orleans.\n\n         \n\nThe map\n\nIn 1731, an architect’s draftsman named Gonichon produced this map, considered the most accurate depiction of New Orleans a decade after serious construction on the new capital began.  Gonichon’s map shows all the city’s original buildings and its first streets.  On the northern edge, you see what residents already called Dauphine Street, even though the actual street did not yet exist.  \n\n    Each plot of land was numbered, and an accompanying chart listed the owners of most properties.  In many cases, Gonichon’s map makes it possible to determine precisely who lived where.  In all, of the roughly 200 privately-owned properties in New Orleans in 1731, between 8 and 10 percent were in the hands of women who were banished from France in 1719.  In many cases, these deported women had cleared the land and built the homes that sat on their lots with their own hands.\n\nThe interactive map shown here illuminates these women's lives and their presence on the land, using Gonichon's map as a lens and a guide. Click on the markers to learn more about the women who lived here. A few contemporary photos of the buildings now found on the women’s property have been included.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Women\n\n\n            In 1719, the Parisian police force was given free rein to arrest women.  The development of the newest French colony, the immense territory known as “Louisiana,” had suddenly become a priority, and officials were willing to use any means necessary to acquire female colonists.  Any woman found on the streets of Paris was at risk of being quickly incarcerated on trumped-up charges and then shipped off across the Atlantic.  A few traveled on a vessel named Les Deux Frères, while most were transported on a ship called La Mutine, or the Mutinous Woman.  Of the hundreds arrested in police raids, roughly 188 women were taken from Paris in chains.  About 60 survived the journey.  In 1720, those survivors found themselves on the Gulf Coast.  Most soon married and began new lives all over the colony – from Natchez to Mobile, from Biloxi to Arkansas, from Natchitoches to Illinois.  During the first decade of New Orleans’s existence, at least 37 survivors resided there.  Many women deported in 1719 were among the original owners of property in what is now the French Quarter.  \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarie Anne Automne, street address unknown\nMarie Avril, Bayou Saint-Jean\nMarie Louise Balivet, the Quai (Decatur Street)\nMarie Baron, near the corner of Orleans and Dauphine.

Our work includes: composing case studies of dispossessions; mapping the movements of bodies and objects among museums; tracking trends in sales of heritage as “art;” compiling bibliographies; identifying useful resources and initiatives for decolonizing; and drafting guidelines for restorative methodologies to track, investigate, and recover from colonial dispossessions.\n \n\n Stephanie Mach - Curator of North American Ethnography at Harvard \n May 22, 2022 \n Stephanie Mach (Diné), a citizen of the Navajo Nation and an anthropologist, joins the Peabody Museum from the Penn Museum, where her work has focused on collections management specializing in access and engagement for university audiences as well as managing the summer internship program. She has served as the co-chair of the Penn Museum Diversity Committee since its founding in 2020.

It provides a rare record of more than a decade of demographic, socioeconomic and health conditions in one of the world’s poorest countries. With data collection rounds in 1998, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2012 for up to 4,000 individuals, the MLSFH permits researchers to investigate the multiple influences that contribute to HIV risks in sexual partnerships, the variety of ways that people manage risk within and outside of marriage, the possible effects of HIV prevention policies and programs, and the mechanisms through which poor rural individuals, families, households, and communities cope with the impacts of high morbidity and mortality that are often—but not always—related to HIV/AIDS. The MLSFH been used to document (i) the influence of social networks on HIV-related behaviors and perceptions, (ii) the HIV prevention strategies employed by individuals in rural high-HIV prevalence contexts, (iii) the relationship between life-course transitions and HIV infection risks, (iv) the acceptability of HIV testing and counseling (HTC) and the consequences of HTC on subsequent behaviors, and (v) the health and well-being across the life-course of individuals facing multiple challenges resulting from high disease burdens and widespread poverty. The MLSFH Newsletter 2013-1 provides a summary of the MLSFH 1998-2012, and the MLSFH Newsletter 2013-2 highlights selected recent MLSFH findings.\nRead the latest newsletter, announcing new research funding: 2023-04-MLSFH Adversity, Aging and ADRD Risk: A Biosocial Lifecourse Approach\nA MLSFH Cohort Profile, published in the International Journal of Epidemiology, summarizes the key findings of the MLSFH. The MLSFH Cohort Profile also provides information about the sampling for the MLSFH, the refreshment of the MLSFH sample over time, and the procedures for HIV testing and counseling that were implemented as part of the MLSFH. It also reports comparisons of the MLSFH study populations with nationally representative datasets, analyses of attrition in the MLSFH sample, and it includes discussions of some specific features of the MLSFH data that have been widely used across many MLSFH-based papers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright © 2023 Malawi Research.

Today’s ruling does not diminish our commitment to educating a diverse nursing workforce that is critical to ensuring quality health care and promoting health for everyone, everywhere. Penn Nursing remains steadfast in its mission to promote equity, advance science, demonstrate practice excellence, and prepare leaders—from all walks of life—in the discipline of nursing.\n\n\n\nTodayPenn Nursing Launches New Masters-Entry Program  Penn Nursing’s new Master of Professional Nursing (MPN) degree offers students with a bachelor’s degree in another field an exciting alternative path to a career in nursing. This entry-level nursing program, offered at the graduate level, prepares students to deliver a full array of health care services to meet the demands of patients and families with increasingly complex health needs.Top StoriesPenn’s Rebecca Clark, PhD, Joins Betty Irene Moore Fellowship Program at UC Davis Nursing SchoolRebecca Clark, PhD, MSN, RN, Assistant Professor of Perinatal Nursing, Midwifery, and Women’s Health at Penn Nursing and a Nurse Scientist at Pennsylvania Hospital, is one of 16 nurse scientists accepted to the fourth cohort of the Betty Irene Moore Fellowship for Nurse Leaders and Innovators. She is the first nurse scientist from Penn to be accepted to this program.University Names Penn Nursing Professor as Evan C Thompson Term Chair for Excellence in Teaching  Interim Provost Beth A. Winkelstein and Vice Provost for Education Karen Detlefsen are pleased to announce the appointment of Penn Nursing’s Jie Deng, PhD, RN, OCN, FAAN, Associate Professor in the Department of Biobehavioral Health Sciences, Faculty Director of the Laboratory of Innovative & Translational Nursing Research, and Senior Fellow in the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, to the Evan C Thompson Term Chair for Excellence in Teaching, beginning July 1, 2023.\n\n\nOur PeopleHospital Understaffing and Poor Work Conditions Associated with Physician and Nurse Burnout and Intent to Leave  A unique collaborative study on hospital clinician wellbeing by teams at 60 of the nation’s best hospitals, defined by Magnet Hospital Recognition, was published today in JAMA Health Forum. The study found that physicians and nurses, even at hospitals known to be good places to work, experienced adverse outcomes during the pandemic and want hospital management to make significant improvements in their work environments and in patient safety. The solutions to high hospital clinician burnout and turnover, they say, are not resilience training for clinicians to better cope with adverse working conditions but organizational improvements that provide safe workloads and better work-life balance.New Fellowships  Four Penn Nursing professors have been selected for new fellowships from national organizations in their respective fields.

Penn Carey Law is one of the most affordable law schools amongst its peers and, over the last five years, its tuition has increased at a much lower rate than its peers. In 2020-21 per capita costs of a University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School education dropped for the first time in at least a decade.\nThe Law School was also one of the few law schools in the country able to freeze tuition for the 2020-2021 academic year in recognition of students’ changed economic circumstances. This decision, coupled with a double-digit increase in financial aid and increased institutional funding to support students in their careers, gave the Law School the flexibility to prioritize the safety of its community and respond nimbly and creatively to an unprecedented crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBright minds. Brighter future. “As a first-generation college graduate, the Law School provides for an invaluable and transformative legal experience, helping to fill a critical gap between my familial experience with higher education and the world of opportunities it affords.”\n Trevor kirby l’23 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nICON. Scholar. Trailblazer. The Dr. Sadie T.M. Alexander Scholarships, established in February 2021, pay tribute to the legacy of Dr. Sadie T.M. Alexander, the first Black woman to graduate from the Law School. \n\n“[Dr. Sadie T.M. Alexander’s] life exemplified interdisciplinary, intellectual curiosity and a deep commitment to public service. She was a true embodiment of Penn Carey Law’s values. With the Dr. Sadie T.M. Alexander scholarships, the Law School honors her legacy and recognizes that a Black woman set an exemplary standard that people from all backgrounds should aspire to reach.”\n Jocelyn A.K. Walcott L’22, Advocacy Chair of the Black Law Students Association \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Expanding globally. Impacting THE world. Increased scholarship support for international students is helping to strengthen Penn Carey Law’s rich and diverse community and offering new perspectives to complex legal issues. Meanwhile, Penn Carey Law students have more opportunities than ever to directly engage withvthe international legal community through enhanced resources for travel—including fellowships, Global Research Seminars, and new collaborative partnerships with law schools across the globe.\n\n\n Betha Igbinosun LLM’20 SJD’23 (pictured) and classmates in Professor Eric Feldman’s fall 2019 Global Research Seminar, Robot Revolution: Legal, Ethical and Policy Challenges of Robotics in the US and Japan, traveled to Japan to meet with industry leaders and learn more about the rapidly evolving legal, ethical and regulatory climate surrounding robotics.\n \n\n\n\nNext chapter\nBEYOND THE CLASSROOM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBEYOND THE CLASSROOM. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTUDENT SPOTLIGHT\nCLINICS SPOTLIGHT\nCAREER PLACEMENT\n\n\n\nAnna sheuL’21\nJustin PrelogarL’20\nFatoumata G.

Waggeh L’20 \n\n\nAs a Summer Associate at Akerman LLP’s New York office, Fatoumata explored the realm of litigation including intellectual property, real estate, land use, and pro bono matters, and assisted an associate with an expert witness deposition for an employment discrimination matter. She also sat on the attorney bench and went on the record while attending federal district court.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday’s challenges. Tomorrow’s opportunities. \nAt the Entrepreneurship Legal Clinic, students work with entrepreneurs at all phases of the business cycle, from pre-formation to scaling to dissolution, turning clients’ dreams into reality.\n \n\n“Those connections, those networking opportunities, the amazing clients that I was able to work with, I don’t think I would’ve been able to experience anything like that until ten years later in my career.”\nAsal Yunusov L’21 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the job learning. \nThe Interdisciplinary Child Advocacy Clinic brings together law, social work, medicine and mental health to advocate across disciplines for vulnerable adolescents. Students represent their clients across a range of venues, often litigating as child advocates in family court and domestic relations court as well as representing undocumented children facing deportation in immigration court.\n \n\n“I learned so much from the clinic about the significant impact we can have working with young children. It was there that I learned about adverse childhood experiences and how critical the early development stage is for a child’s life trajectory.”\nRachel Mark L’14 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPENN CAREY LAW #1 \n\nIN THE COUNTRY \nfor New Grad Employment \n\n“The Law School’s career services were incredibly supportive and allowed me to pursue my dream career.

He most recently worked for the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law in Washington, D.C., where he collaborated with community leaders, former prosecutors from the Department of Justice, and the Matthew Shepard Foundation to host hate crime response trainings for local prosecutors and law enforcement officers throughout the country. Previously, he worked as a presidential appointee in the Obama administration at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as the Deputy White House Liaison.\n\n\n“By anchoring my law school experience to the Toll Scholar program and its network, I’ve not only been able to create a tangible vision for my public service career, but also take the necessary steps as a law student that will best position me to accomplish this vision.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToll fellow Student Advocates \n\n\n \nKATE DIVASTO L’21 TOLL fellow \n\nKate’s experiences growing up in a low-income household inspired her to work alongside youth—especially court-involved youth—to empower them and the communities harmed by systemic racism and other intersectional forms of oppression. To this end, she spent her 1L summer with the Youth Justice Project of Community Legal Services of Philadelphia where she worked with youth on employment discrimination claims, disability benefit claims, and expungement and sealing petitions in light of new Clean Slate legislation. She later interned with the Civil Action Practice of the Bronx Defenders on projects related to security of housing and public benefits for residents of the Bronx.\n\n\n“As a Toll Fellow, I feel privileged and humbled to know that I can spend my career in public interest starting from my very first legal position…The Toll Fellowship has allowed me to meet legal mentors, learn to be a client-partner focused attorney, and hopefully go on to mentor other attorneys in the future.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalk-In Legal Assistance Project\nMobile TEAMS\nThe Pennsylvania 30 Day Fund\n\n\n\nCatalyzing change through action. \n\nWalk-In Legal Assistance Project The Law School’s Walk-In Legal Assistance Project (WILA) provides accessible civil legal services to people experiencing homelessness or who are housing insecure.\n\n\n“My work with WILA over the past two and a half years has made me a better law student by giving me context to the cases I read in my casebook.”\nChad Keizer L’21 Director of the Law School’s Walk-In Legal Assistance Project \n\n\n\n\n\nHelping where it’s needed most. \n\nMobile TEAMS In 2018, the Toll Public Interest Center launched Mobile TEAMS (Trained Educators and Advocates Mobilized for Service) to provide pro bono legal assistance to outlying areas and populations without accessible legal services. Since then, groups of Penn Carey Law students have traveled around the state to help Pennsylvanians resolve immigration and unemployment issues.\n\n\n“When I went to law school, I went with the idea of giving back to the community. I was determined to get that on-the-ground experience in the United States, and I can’t overstate how helpful it was to get real experience.”\nNatalia Guerrero Vergel LLM’20 StudentVolunteer with Mobile TEAMS \n\n\n\n\n\nWorld-class education leads to small business success. \n\nThe Pennsylvania 30 Day Fund The Pennsylvania 30 Day Fund, started by real estate developer Jeff Bartos, launched in May 2020 to provide up to $3,000 in forgivable loans to Pennsylvanian small businesses in need. Supervised by Michael Knoll, Theodore K. Warner Professor of Law and Professor of Real Estate, the project was led in part by three Penn Carey Law JD/MBA students who helped develop a system to track and process the high volume of applications. As of May 2021, the Fund had raised about $2.6 million and helped nearly 900 small businesses around the state.\n\n\n“Lawyers didn’t have a lot of opportunities to be of service during the [pandemic] but working with the Pennsylvania 3O Day Fund has enabled our students to make a real difference for small business owners – and it’s also been rewarding for them as well.”\nMichael Knoll, Theodore K.

The Legal History Consortium, jointly sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School and Penn’s Graduate History Department, was formed to promote interdisciplinary research, scholarship, and education in law and history.\nProfessor Tani L’07 PhD’11, Seaman Family University Professor, the first graduate of the University’s JD/PhD program in American Legal History and the 24th Penn Integrates Knowledge University Professor, has taken on the role of coordinating the Consortium, which includes sponsored speaker series, a joint degree program in law and history, and academic conferences.\n\n\n\n\n Real-time insights. Lasting change. The Covid Coverage Litigation Tracker, created by Professor Tom Baker, the William Maul Measey Professor of Law, is providing invaluable insight into the pandemic’s effects on insurance contracts and enabling scholars and researchers to study in real time how courts respond to the challenges posed by a new wave of mass litigation.\nWith over 1,500 cases included, it has been cited regularly in court filings, judicial opinions, and publications such as The Wall Street Journal, Time, Bloomberg, and The National Law Review.\n\n\n\n\n Big Data,Big Solutions. Through the largest ever study of residential leases, Professor David Hoffman offers a glimpse into the Philadelphia rental housing market based on nearly 170,000 residential leases filed in support of more than 200,000 Philadelphia eviction proceedings from 2005 through 2019.\nFuture research and scholarship will continue to analyze the dataset with an eye toward proposing better regulatory strategies to address the existing disparities in how formal legal rules affect citizens.\n\n\n\n\n \nAdvancing Justice through Bail Reform.\n\n\nThe Quattrone Center for the Fair Administration of Justice continued its innovative analysis of the criminal justice system with two studies on cash bail, finding that defendants subject to pretrial detention are more likely to be convicted and less likely to receive favorable plea terms than similarly situated defendants who make bail. The studies generated more nuanced discussions surrounding cash bail reform and have already led to changes in some jurisdictions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Focus on Faculty Excellence. \n\n\n\n \n2016 – Professor David Skeel was appointed to serve on the federal government’s Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico in 2016 and became Chairman of the Board in 2020.\n\n\n\n \n2017 – Professor Christopher Yoo was appointed to FCC’s Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee to provide advice and make recommendations to the FCC on how to accelerate the deployment of high-speed Internet access.\n\n\n\n \n2019 – Professor Dorothy Roberts published the Harvard Law Review Foreword on prison abolition constitutionalism, becoming the second black woman to pen the Foreword of the esteemed law journal and the second Penn Carey Law professor to do so.\n\n\n\n \n2019 – Professor Louis S.

Practicing high impact philanthropy starts with a social impact goal, then uses the best available evidence, considerations of cost and impact, and a commitment to ongoing learning to achieve that goal. It’s not about how much you give, but how well you give to drive positive, social change.\n\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews & Blogs\nThe Latest\n More News\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 22, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\nAuthors Patience Marime-Ball and Ruth Shaber discuss gender diversity at CHIP event\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJuly 18, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\nCHIP Founding Executive Director Kat Rosqueta Featured on \"Top of Mind with Julie Rose\"\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 24, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\nSP2 and Spotify Partner on Innovative Course: Social Policy Through Podcasting\n\n\n More News\n\n\n\n\n\n[The High Impact Giving Guide] is the single most useful guide to smart giving that I’ve come across since I began writing about philanthropy nearly two years ago.\n\n– Marc Gunther, Nonprofit Chronicles\n\n\n Read the Full Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Center for High Impact Philanthropy\n3815 Walnut Street\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104-6179 (Map)\nimpact@sp2.upenn.edu | 215-573-7266\n\n\n\nWho We Are\nWhat We Do\nGuidance by Issue\nEducation Programs\nNews & Events\nConnect with Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n \nDisclaimer\n|\nEmergency Services\n|\nPrivacy Policy\n|\nReport Accessibility Issues and Get Help\n|\nReport Copyright Infringement\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCopyright © 2023\t\t\t\t\tCenter for High Impact Philanthropy – University of Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This is an introductory course at the intersection of Machine Learning (ML) and Embedded Internet of Things (IoT) Devices which covers machine learning applications and algorithms using embedded hardware, sensors, actuators and software. Embedding machine learning in a device at the extreme end point - right at the data source - is fundamentally different from general data-center style machine learning. Embedded ML is all about real-time processing of time-series data that comes directly from sensors. By the end of this course, students will collect and preprocess data to build a dataset, design a model, train a model, evaluate and optimize the pipeline, convert the model to run on hardware, deploy the model on a microcontroller, make inference and roll out applications. This will enable future applications development across medical devices, home appliances, industrial automation, wild-life conservation, smart agriculture and many more. Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of programming (CIS110 or equivalent) and basic knowledge of Python and basic knowledge of electronics and circuits. We provide the background, tools and assignments for machine learning and embedded systems using TensorFlow, Google Colab, and ARM Cortex32 hardware platforms.   \n\n\nWorkflow & Grading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule\n\n\n\n\nResources\nESE3600 Syllabus\n\n\nArduino Wesbite\n\n\nTensorflow LiteWesbite\n\nPete Warden's Magic Wand Capture tool\n\n Pete Warden's Open Speech Recording plugin \n\n Some example project videos \n\nArnav Ghatiwala - ESE3600 F22\nTinyML - KWS action on robot\nTinyML - Trajectory detection on robot\n\nDhruv Agarwal - ESE3600 F22\nPedestrian light detection TinyML app\n\nJosh Ludan - ESE3600 F22\nTinyML dungeon and dragons dice reader\n\n\n\n\n\nStaffInstructor\n\n Professor Rahul Mangharam [rahulm@seas.upenn.edu]\n\n\n \n Teaching Assistants\n\n Manasa Sathyan [msathyan@seas.upenn.edu]  \n\n Tejas Agarwal [tejasag@seas.upenn.edu] \n\n\n\nBlog\n\n\n Github repository is set to Public - Click on icon below.Collect your Hardware kits post Spring Break 2023 or drop by Levine 279 (XLAB)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

the Weingarten Center to create a state-of-the-art test center that addresses the diverse needs of students with disabilities. Transformative describes the Foundation's impact on how the Weingarten Center represents a catalyst for change with the inauguration of two specialized roles: Case Manager for Integrated Care and Instructional Design Specialist. The test center and new staff positions coincide with Penn's mission of innovation, reflecting how the Integrated Care initiative has become a reality because of the Moh Foundation's generous spirit.\t\t\t\n\n- Director of the Weingarten Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a Gift to University Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Footer\n\n\nAthletics\nDiversity\nHealth & Wellness\nLibraries\nOnline Learning\nPenn Global\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\nUniversity Life Calendar\nStudent Jobs\n\n\n\n\nHelp\n\n\nContact Us\nMaps\nParking\n\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nAddress\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104\n\nTelephone:\n(215) 898-6081\n\n\n\n\nLegal\n\n\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy Policy\nReport Accessibility Issues and Get Help\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip to content\n\n\n\nOpen toolbar\n\n \n\n\n\n\nAccessibility Tools\n\n\n\nIncrease Text \n\n\n\nDecrease Text \n\n\n\nGrayscale \n\n\n\nHigh Contrast \n\n\n\nNegative Contrast \n\n\n\nLight Background \n\n\n\nLinks Underline \n\n\n\nReadable Font \n\n\n\n\nReset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It’s not about how much you give, but how well you give to drive positive, social change.\n\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNews & Blogs\nThe Latest\n More News\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 22, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\nAuthors Patience Marime-Ball and Ruth Shaber discuss gender diversity at CHIP event\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJuly 18, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\nCHIP Founding Executive Director Kat Rosqueta Featured on \"Top of Mind with Julie Rose\"\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tJune 24, 2022\t\t\t\t\t\nSP2 and Spotify Partner on Innovative Course: Social Policy Through Podcasting\n\n\n More News\n\n\n\n\n\n[The High Impact Giving Guide] is the single most useful guide to smart giving that I’ve come across since I began writing about philanthropy nearly two years ago.\n\n– Marc Gunther, Nonprofit Chronicles\n\n\n Read the Full Article\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Center for High Impact Philanthropy\n3815 Walnut Street\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104-6179 (Map)\nimpact@sp2.upenn.edu | 215-573-7266\n\n\n\nWho We Are\nWhat We Do\nGuidance by Issue\nEducation Programs\nNews & Events\nConnect with Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\nYoutube\n\n\n\nLinkedIn\n\n\n \nDisclaimer\n|\nEmergency Services\n|\nPrivacy Policy\n|\nReport Accessibility Issues and Get Help\n|\nReport Copyright Infringement\n\n\n\t\t\t\tCopyright © 2023\t\t\t\t\tCenter for High Impact Philanthropy – University of Pennsylvania\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The primary goal is to enhance the research productivity of Wharton faculty by minimizing the operational costs, both time and money, of conducting research.  The primary services provided are maintaining and updating facilities, substantial participant pools, and efficient staffing for a state-of-the-art experimental research laboratory that will be a shared asset for all faculty and students doing behavioral research.  It contributes to Wharton’s reputation for excellence in academic research and enhance our ability to attract and retain the very best scholars.\nInformation for Prospective WBL Panel Members \nThe WBL is located in a newly renovated space in the lower part of Steinberg-Dietrich Hall, Suite 400. The lab is to the right of Joe’s Cafe.\n\r\n    We are currently running online and on-campus studies. The online studies are typically Qualtrics surveys or Zoom meetings and run anywhere from five minutes to one hour. Participants are paid for completing these studies with Amazon gift cards and the typical payment for a remote study is $5/30 minutes and $10/hour, respectively.\r\n    Participants are paid in cash for completing on-campus studies at the same rate, but sometimes may exceed that amount for studies in which payment depends on performance in some way.\r\n\nDuring a session, panel members may complete questionnaires, participate in online experiments, or interact in groups. \nMembers of the WBL panel are mainly Penn students, but also include Penn staff and members of the community. By joining the panel, you are agreeing to maintain the integrity of the research by completing all answers honestly and to the best of your ability. Each lab begins a new session every week for on-campus research. Online studies come sporadically and you will receive an email when a new session is posted. Please note that you can only participate once in any given session and may not be eligible for all sessions due to the specifications of the research.\nIf you do not have an account yet, please Create an Account to Participate.\nInformation for Wharton Researchers\nIf your research project requires data collection in our on-campus laboratories, please contact Mary Spratt.  If your research project requires data collection from off-campus sources (e.g., online samples, personal interviews, etc.), please contact  Susan McCafferty.\nHistory\nThe Wharton Behavioral Lab was officially launched in 2005.  The Faculty Director is Maurice Schweitzer, the Cecilia Yen Koo Professor of Operations, Information and Decisions at The Wharton School.  The Senior On-Campus Research Coordinator is Mary Spratt.  The Senior Off-Campus Research Coordinator is Susan McCafferty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2023 - Wharton Behavioral Lab\nReport accessibility issues and get help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This requires achieving carbon neutrality shortly after 2050. In the United States, industrial emissions represent 22% of greenhouse gas emissions and are particularly hard to decarbonize, because (1) the processes emit CO2 as a byproduct of chemical reactions and (2) these industries require high-grade heat input. This study focuses on some of these industries, namely cement, lime, glass, and steelmaking. This work details the incumbent kiln and furnace technologies and explores the developing processes with examples of existing projects that aim to reduce carbon emissions, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), fuel switching, and other technological changes.Download the PDFWatch the VideoDownload the PresentationListen to the PodcastJanuary 2022Jennifer Wilcox, Helene Pilorge, Maxwell PisciottaResearch topicsHydrogen Production & StorageCarbon Capture, Utilization, & StorageMineral CarbonizationAmmonia ProductionLife Cycle AnalysisTechno-economic AssessmentCatalysisGeographic Information Systems MappingCarbon Dioxide RemovalDirect Air CaptureMiscellaneousDownload the PDFDownload the PresentationWatch the VideoListen to the PodcastAn overview of the status and challenges of CO2 storage in minerals and geological formationsSince the Industrial Revolution, anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have grown exponentially, accumulating in the atmosphere and leading to global warming. According to the IPCC (IPCC Special Report 2018), atmospheric warming should be less than 2 â to avoid the most serious consequences associated with climate change. This goal can be achieved in part by reducing CO2 emissions, together with capturing and sequestering CO2 from point sources. The most mature storage technique is sequestration in deep saline aquifers. In addition, CO2 can be mineralized and sequestered in solid form by various techniques: ex-situ, surficial and in situ mineralization. Ex situ and surficial approaches may produce valuable products while mitigating environmental hazards. In-situ mineralization uses ultramafic and mafic geological formations for permanent, solid storage. A portfolio that limits warming to less than 2 â by 2100 will include avoiding CO2 emissions and removal of CO2 from air. Regardless of the specific mix of approaches, it will be essential to permanently sequester tens of billions of tons of CO2. Maximizing the potential of all of these storage technologies will help to meet global climate goals. The research agenda published by the National Academy of Science (NASEM 2019) calls for about $1 billion over a 10-20 year time period to advance deployment of CO2 sequestration in deep sedimentary reservoirs at the GtCO2/yr scale and develop CO2 mineralization at the MtCO2/yr scale.Download the PDFWatch the VideoDownload the PresentationListen to the PodcastNovember 2019Jennifer Wilcox,\nPeter Psarras,\nHelene PilorgeResearch topicsHydrogen Production & StorageCarbon Capture, Utilization, & StorageMineral CarbonizationAmmonia ProductionLife Cycle AnalysisTechno-economic AssessmentCatalysisGeographic Information Systems MappingCarbon Dioxide RemovalDirect Air CaptureMiscellaneousDownload the PDFDownload the PresentationWatch the VideoListen to the PodcastMore ResearchFeatured VideoPenn Engagement DaysIn the Fall of 2020, CECL moved to our new home in Penn Engineering and the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy.

As a consequence, if someone's\n          willingness to receive a vaccine predicts other differences in\n          behavior our estimates would be incorrect.

Yoo is Professor of Law, Communication, and Computer and Information Science and Founding Director of the Center for Technology, Innovation and Competition at the University of Pennsylvania. His research focuses on exploring the insights that the principles of network engineering and the economics of imperfect competition can provide into the regulation of the Internet and other forms of electronic communications. He has been a leading voice in the \"network neutrality\" debate that has dominated Internet policy over the past several years. He is also pursuing research on copyright theory, standard essential patents, as well as the history of presidential power.

These studies report coverage levels for a wide range of speed tiers and technologies in both urban and rural areas. Although the European mapping study focuses on Next Generation Access (NGA), which it defines to be service providing download speeds of at least 30 Mbps, a close analysis reveals that the study actually reports data for 25 Mbps service. Data from these studies served as the basis for analysis in this report.\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\nThe Facts\nCountry Case Studies\nCountry Comparisons\nContact\n \n\n\n\n© 2014 Center for Technology, Innovation, and Competition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Through these experiments and their interactions with Penn's graduate students, high schoolers are introduced to cutting edge research while learning about the\nexciting opportunities for careers in the sciences. in Science Day 2011, our pilot yearFive Biology labs and 25 high school students from Maustbaum AVTS participated. Thanks to the overwhelmingly positive response, we doubled in size this year, and invited 50 students from Science Leadership Academy and Roxborough High School to visit 10 biology labs. We hope to expand further in the future to include other science departments and additional dates in the fall/winter semester.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPowered by \n\nCreate your own unique website with customizable templates.\n\nGet Started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Focusing solely on this much-loved and familiar score, the result is pure and vibrant, brimming with nuance and emotional heft. “Many choreographers can create interesting movement; few can make it mean so much.” (Chicago Tribune) \n\r\nStudent tickets only $10!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                Handle\r\n            \n\n\n\nFilter by: \n\r\n    Categories \n\n\n\n\nAcademic Calendar\nAthletics\nConference\nFair\nNetworking Event\nOrientation\nOther\nPerformance\nRally\nScreening\nSocial Event\nStudent Group Event/Limited Attendance\nTalk / Panel\nWorkshop\n\nView Past Events\n\n\n\n\nWednesday, July 19th\n\n\n\n\n\n6:00 pm\n8:00 pm\n\n\r\n                        Workshop                        \n\nPenn Summer Dance Series\nPlatt 175\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd to Calendar\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Hosted By\r\n                                    \n\nPlatt Student Performing Arts House \n\n\n\r\n                                        Contact\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Date\r\n                                    \n\r\n                                        July 19th                                                                            \n\n\n\r\n                                        Time\r\n                                    \n\r\n                                        6:00pm - 8:00pm\r\n                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                        Where\r\n                                    \n\r\n                                        Platt 175\r\n                                    \n\n\n\nShow on Google Maps\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Category\r\n                                    \n\nWorkshop\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Share Event\r\n                                    \n\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Facebook\nDirect URL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn Summer Dance Series\nMissing dance?

An uncompromising artist and multiple Grammy® Award-winner, Marsalis is backed by his longtime quartet – pianist Joey Calderazzo, bassist Eric Revis and drummer Justin Faulkner – for a kaleidoscope of moods from the group’s latest album, The Secret Between the Shadow and the Soul, its most emotionally wide-ranging and melody-driven collection to date. “As immediately intimate as it is infinitely expansive,” the album “serves as a snapshot of where the quartet currently stands: at the top of its game.” (DownBeat) \n\r\nStudent tickets only $10!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday, September 30th\n\n\n\n\n\n8:00 pm\n9:30 pm\n\n\r\n                        Performance                        \n\nThe Acting Company - Odyssey\nAnnenberg Center for the Performing Arts, Harold Prince Theatre\n\n\nOpen to all Theater\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd to Calendar\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Hosted By\r\n                                    \n\nPenn Live Arts \n\n\n\r\n                                        Contact\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Date\r\n                                    \n\r\n                                        September 30th                                                                            \n\n\n\r\n                                        Time\r\n                                    \n\r\n                                        8:00pm - 9:30pm\r\n                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                        Where\r\n                                    \n\r\n                                        Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts, Harold Prince Theatre\r\n                                    \n\n\n\nShow on Google Maps\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Tickets\r\n                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                            Cost: $10                                        \n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Category\r\n                                    \n\nPerformance\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Tags\r\n                                    \n\nOpen to all Theater \n\n\n\r\n                                        Official Page\r\n                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                            Visit Page\r\n                                        \n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Share Event\r\n                                    \n\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Facebook\nDirect URL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Acting Company - Odyssey\nWhat lengths would you go to get home?

Based on the revelatory translation by Penn professor and MacArthur Fellow Emily Wilson, which was named to The New York Times’ top 100 notable books list for 2018, this bold adaptation brings fresh humor and grace to a story we all think we know.\n\r\nStudent tickets only $10!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7:00 pm\n8:30 pm\n\n\r\n                        Performance                        \n\nThe Acting Company - Odyssey\nAnnenberg Center for the Performing Arts, Harold Prince Theatre\n\n\nOpen to all Theater\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd to Calendar\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Hosted By\r\n                                    \n\nPenn Live Arts \n\n\n\r\n                                        Contact\r\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Date\r\n                                    \n\r\n                                        October 1st                                                                            \n\n\n\r\n                                        Time\r\n                                    \n\r\n                                        7:00pm - 8:30pm\r\n                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                        Where\r\n                                    \n\r\n                                        Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts, Harold Prince Theatre\r\n                                    \n\n\n\nShow on Google Maps\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Tickets\r\n                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                            Cost: $10                                        \n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Category\r\n                                    \n\nPerformance\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Tags\r\n                                    \n\nOpen to all Theater \n\n\n\r\n                                        Official Page\r\n                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                            Visit Page\r\n                                        \n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Share Event\r\n                                    \n\nShare on Twitter\nShare on Facebook\nDirect URL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Acting Company - Odyssey\nWhat lengths would you go to get home?

Hailing from the Netherlands, the all-male vocal ensemble Cappella Pratensis specializes in interpreting music found in manuscripts from the 15th and 16th centuries. Switzerland’s Sollazzo Ensemble is critically acclaimed for its highly expressive delivery of late medieval and early Renaissance music.

Special Guest Yasmin Williams\n“A vocalist of unerring instinct,” the Grammy® award-winning Aoife O'Donovan makes her Penn Live Arts debut in a special concert performing the music of Bruce Springsteen’s acoustic triumph, Nebraska, in its entirety. “Saluting Springsteen’s songcraft with clear, pitch-perfect articulation and affable delivery,” O'Donovan pairs this raw, folk album with favorites from her critically acclaimed Age of Apathy, offering “quietly startling songs that are at once intimate and ambitious, autobiographical and metaphysical.” (The New York Times) O’Donovan’s performance will feature an opening set by guitarist Yasmin Williams whose “music transcends the standard idea of what guitarists should do.” (NPR Music) \n\r\nStudent tickets only $10!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday, October 22nd\n\n\n\n\n\n9:00 am\n5:00 pm\n\n\r\n                        Social Event                        \n\nGreek Week\nTBD\n\n\nFraternity and Sorority Life IGC IFC PHC Greek Week\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd to Calendar\n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Hosted By\r\n                                    \n\nOffice of Fraternity and Sorority Life Panhellenic Council (PHC) Interfraternity Council (IFC) Intercultural Greek Council (IGC) \n\n\n\r\n                                        Contact\r\n                                    \n\n\r\n                                        \r\n                                        Janae Tucker                                        \r\n                                        \n\n\n\n\r\n                                        Date\r\n                                    \n\r\n                                        October 22nd                                         ‐ October 27th                                    \n\n\n\r\n                                        Time\r\n                                    \n\r\n                                        9:00am -

Woven into many varying religions, hymnals represent a catalog of ideals worshipers agree upon, such as how we treat and care for others, particularly those who are less fortunate. In poor hymnal, Lang adds to this tradition, posing the question of whether the hymns we’re singing today are truly reflective of a society that feels a responsibility to care for and support one another.\n\r\nStudent tickets only $10!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\nMaps\nParking\n\n\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\nAddress\n\nPhiladelphia, PA 19104\n\nTelephone:\n(215) 898-5000\n\n\n\n\nCopyright\nDisclaimer\nPrivacy Policy\nReport Accessibility Issues and Get Help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The designation of IMS Fellow has been a significant honor for over 85 years. Each Fellow is assessed by a committee of their peers and has demonstrated distincition in research or leadership that has profoundly influenced the field.

Those often co-occurring conditions increase the risk for suicidal ideation and suicide. Veterans may be prescribed opioids (for pain) and benzodiazepines (for anxiety or insomnia). The committee will conduct a study to evaluate the effects of opioids and benzodiazepines on all-cause mortality of veterans, including suicide.\nSchisterman serves on “Developing a Framework to Address Legal, Ethical, Regulatory, and Policy Issues for Research Specific to Pregnant and Lactating Persons.\" Approximately 4 million pregnant people in the United States give birth annually, and 70 percent of these individuals take at least one prescription medication during their pregnancy. Yet, pregnant and lactating persons are often excluded from clinical trials, and often have to make treatment decisions without an adequate understanding of the benefits and risks to themselves and their developing fetus or newborn baby. The committee will develop a framework for addressing medicolegal and liability issues when planning or conducting research specific to pregnant and lactating persons.\n \n   \n\n\nView More Announcements \n \n\n\n\n\n\nIn the News\n\n\n\n\n\n Examining Places Where People Experiencing Homelessness Overdose \n February 2023 \n Elizabeth Nesoff, PhD, MPH discusses her recently published study in the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics (LDI) blog investigating neighborhood features that were correlated with fatal opioid overdoses among the homeless population in New York City. Dr. Nesoff uses these discoveries to make important policy recommendations with respect to targeted outreach and other interventions.\n  \n\n Researchers examine measles antibodies in pregnant patients at 2 Philadelphia Hospitals \n February 2023 \n Jeffrey Morris, PhD and Jeffrey Gerber, MD, PhD, MSCE collaborated with researchers to examine measles serostatus among pregnant persons about to give birth and whether rubella serostatus, which is routinely assessed during pregnancy, can serve as a proxy for measles serostatus.\n  \n\n Podcast focuses on developing new ways to identify aggressive breast cancer \n January 2023 \n Anne Marie McCarthy, PhD was featured on the Real Pink Podcast where she discussed the development of new ways to identify people with high risk of aggressive breast cancer. \n  \n\n\nView More News \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DBEI distinctively brings together expertise in biostatistics, epidemiology and informatics, to advance population-health science.\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nUpcoming Events\n\n\n\n\n\n Third Penn Conference on Big Data in Biomedical and Population Health Sciences \n  September 18, 2023\n(All day)\n \n   \n\n Third Penn Conference on Big Data in Biomedical and Population Health Sciences \n  September 19, 2023\n(All day)\n \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Research\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n With Climate Change, More Cases of Kidney Stones  \n Epidemiology \n   \n\n Masking Policies for Covid-19: What Does the Science Say? \n Biostatistics \n   \n\n Turning the Tables on Diseases that Spread Spatially  \n Biostatistics \n   \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Us\n\n\nTo understand health and disease today, we need new thinking and novel science —the kind  we create when multiple disciplines work together from the ground up. That is why this department has put forward a bold vision in population-health science: a single academic home for biostatistics, epidemiology and informatics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© 2023 Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania.

We believe this is an area of teacher knowledge and ability that is not well understood or developed in teacher education or professional development, but is central to what teachers do on a daily basis.

All U.S. employers must properly complete Form I-9 for each individual they hire for employment in the United States. This includes\n    citizens and noncitizens. Both employees and employers (or authorized representatives of the employer) must complete the form.On the form, an employee must attest to his or her employment authorization. The employee must also present his or her employer with acceptable documents evidencing identity and employment authorization. The employer must examine the employment eligibility\n    and identity document(s) an employee presents to determine whether the document(s) reasonably appear to be genuine and to relate to the employee and record the document information on Form I-9. The lists of acceptable documents can be found on the\n    last page of the form. Employers must retain Form I-9 for a designated period and make it available for inspection by authorized government officers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen does a new hire need to complete Form I-9 in Workday?\n\n\nThere are two parts to Form I-9\nPart 1 of Form I-9:\n\nThis is a self-service feature through your Workday inbox.\nIt needs to be completed no later than the first day of employment. \n\nPart 2 of Form I-9:\n\n\nThis is an in-person task with Onboard@Penn or an Authorized Representative.\nIt needs to be completed no later than the third business day following the date of hire.\n\nIf you start working on Monday, this needs to be completed by the end of business on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is required to complete Form I-9 in Workday?\n\n\nPart 1 of Form I-9: \n\nLog into your Workday account\nNavigate to your inbox\nSelect \"Complete Part 1 of Form I-9\"\nEnter all required fields\n*A Social Security Number is not required\n\nPart 2 of Form I-9:\n\nAcquire necessary documents\n\nYou must provide (1) document from List A (Documents That Establish Identity and Employment Authorization) - OR - one (1) document from List B (Documents That Establish Identity) and one (1) document from List C (Documents That Establish Employment\r\n            Authorization)\r\n        \nDOCUMENTS NEED TO BE UNEXPIRED AND ORIGINAL. WE CANNOT ACCEPT SCANS OR COPIES\n\nMake an appointment with Onboard@Penn to complete the physical inspection of your work authorization documents\nMake an appointment online to present your documents in person.\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf someone has worked at Penn before, do they need to complete I-9?\n\n\nFederal regulations allow the employer to rely on the original Form I-9 and complete Section 3 when an employee is rehired within three (3) years of the date of the original Form I-9.\nSome examples include: \n1.     An employee who worked at Penn from 2016 to 2019 is rehired in 2020. This employee will be required to complete a new I-9 because the original Form I-9 is more than 3 years old.\n2.     An employee was originally hired in 1985 and retired in 2018. In 2020, the employee was rehired for a temporary position. This employee will have to complete Form I-9 because their original hire date is prior to the Form I-9\r\n    regulation so there is no Form I-9 on file for them.\n3.      A student worker was hired in 2020 and graduated in 2021. The student worker was terminated and then rehired into a staff position in 2022. This does not require a new Form I- 9; however, it does require a reverification\r\n    of employment authorization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if a new  hire can't get to Onboard@Penn?\n\n\nPenn participates in the CUPA Consortium for Reciprocal Forms I-9. Instructions for using this option can be found on the Onboard@Penn website.\nTo complete a reciprocal Form I-9, you will need to:Obtain a Form I-9 with the University of Pennsylvania's information and complete Part 1.Confirm your zip code with an Onboard@Penn specialist as well as your official start date in Workday.Be provided a list of Consortium sites according to your zip code.Coordinate an appointment with the Consortium site.Complete physical inspection of unexpired, original items from the lists of acceptable documents with an Authorized Representative from the Consortium\n        Site. They will complete Part 2.Send color scans of the complete Form I-9 and the documents back to Onboard@Penn via SecureShare.Mail original Form I-9 and colored scans of documents used to: Onboard@Penn, 3601 Walnut Street, 2nd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19104.For additional assistance, please contact the Penn Employee Solution Center or call (215) 898-7372. An Onboard@Penn representative will provide guidance.The list of acceptable documents can be found here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if a new hire will not be on campus at any time to present documents?\n\n\n                            Please contact the Penn Employee Solution Center or call (215) 898-7372. An Onboard@Penn representative will provide guidance.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do new hires need to bring physical documents to Onboard@Penn when they resume operations if they sent them virtually?\n\n\nSubmitting employment authorization documents virtually was a temporary stopgap option due to COVID-19. \nEmployers are still required by the Federal government to verify all new employees’ original documents physically, in person. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if the new employee is a foreign national who is unable to obtain a Social Security Number due to the Social Security Administration office's closures due to COVID-19? Can they still complete their I-9?\n\n\n\nForm I-9 can be completed without a Social Security Number. Information regarding the process of applying for a Social Security number can be found here on UPenn's ISSS website. \nPlease note that when new hires receive their Social Security card in the mail, they will need to bring the original card to Onboard@Penn to have their Social Security Number verified and updated in Workday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat documents are required for non-immigrant hires to complete Part 2 of Form I-9?\n\n\nThe list of acceptable documents can be found on the USCIS website.ALL DOCUMENTS NEED TO BE UNEXPIRED AND ORIGINAL. WE CANNOT ACCEPT SCANS, COPIES, OR ANY OTHER FORMAT.The following are examples of the original, unexpired documents that may be required in addition to documents presented for completion of Form I-9:PassportWork Authorization Document\n        I-20 for F-1 Visa (all pages)DS-2019 for J-1 VisaI-797 for H-1 VisaMost recent I-94 (printed from DHS website)Employment Authorization Card (if applicable)\n        Student on OPT or STEM-OPT extensionPending Permanent ResidencyJ-2 or M-1 work authorization status)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy hasn't a new hire's direct deposit information been processed if they already completed both Parts 1 and 2 of Form I-9?\n\n\nEmployees also need to complete all the onboarding tasks in their Workday inbox. Some items require clicking the orange \"submit\" button at the bottom of the screen. Once all these tasks are completed, both Parts of Form I-9,\r\n    direct deposit information will be processed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\nLinks List\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkday@Penn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn HR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU@Penn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPennCard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn Global\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         University of Pennsylvania    Onboard@Penn 3601 Walnut Street, 2nd Floor Philadelphia, PA 19104-3433 SolutionCenter@upenn.edu (215) 898-7372         Home                                             Penn Home          Penn HR Home          U@Penn             Copyright © 2023 The University of Pennsylvania    Copyright     Equal Opportunity Employer     Legal Notices     Clery Act     Report Accessibility Issues and Get Help             ",

All U.S. employers must properly complete Form I-9 for each individual they hire for employment in the United States. This includes\n    citizens and noncitizens. Both employees and employers (or authorized representatives of the employer) must complete the form.On the form, an employee must attest to his or her employment authorization. The employee must also present his or her employer with acceptable documents evidencing identity and employment authorization. The employer must examine the employment eligibility\n    and identity document(s) an employee presents to determine whether the document(s) reasonably appear to be genuine and to relate to the employee and record the document information on Form I-9. The lists of acceptable documents can be found on the\n    last page of the form. Employers must retain Form I-9 for a designated period and make it available for inspection by authorized government officers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen does a new hire need to complete Form I-9 in Workday?\n\n\nThere are two parts to Form I-9\nPart 1 of Form I-9:\n\nThis is a self-service feature through your Workday inbox.\nIt needs to be completed no later than the first day of employment. \n\nPart 2 of Form I-9:\n\n\nThis is an in-person task with Onboard@Penn or an Authorized Representative.\nIt needs to be completed no later than the third business day following the date of hire.\n\nIf you start working on Monday, this needs to be completed by the end of business on Thursday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is required to complete Form I-9 in Workday?\n\n\nPart 1 of Form I-9: \n\nLog into your Workday account\nNavigate to your inbox\nSelect \"Complete Part 1 of Form I-9\"\nEnter all required fields\n*A Social Security Number is not required\n\nPart 2 of Form I-9:\n\nAcquire necessary documents\n\nYou must provide (1) document from List A (Documents That Establish Identity and Employment Authorization) - OR - one (1) document from List B (Documents That Establish Identity) and one (1) document from List C (Documents That Establish Employment\r\n            Authorization)\r\n        \nDOCUMENTS NEED TO BE UNEXPIRED AND ORIGINAL. WE CANNOT ACCEPT SCANS OR COPIES\n\nMake an appointment with Onboard@Penn to complete the physical inspection of your work authorization documents\nMake an appointment online to present your documents in person.\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf someone has worked at Penn before, do they need to complete I-9?\n\n\nFederal regulations allow the employer to rely on the original Form I-9 and complete Section 3 when an employee is rehired within three (3) years of the date of the original Form I-9.\nSome examples include: \n1.     An employee who worked at Penn from 2016 to 2019 is rehired in 2020. This employee will be required to complete a new I-9 because the original Form I-9 is more than 3 years old.\n2.     An employee was originally hired in 1985 and retired in 2018. In 2020, the employee was rehired for a temporary position. This employee will have to complete Form I-9 because their original hire date is prior to the Form I-9\r\n    regulation so there is no Form I-9 on file for them.\n3.      A student worker was hired in 2020 and graduated in 2021. The student worker was terminated and then rehired into a staff position in 2022. This does not require a new Form I- 9; however, it does require a reverification\r\n    of employment authorization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if a new  hire can't get to Onboard@Penn?\n\n\nPenn participates in the CUPA Consortium for Reciprocal Forms I-9. Instructions for using this option can be found on the Onboard@Penn website.\nTo complete a reciprocal Form I-9, you will need to:Obtain a Form I-9 with the University of Pennsylvania's information and complete Part 1.Confirm your zip code with an Onboard@Penn specialist as well as your official start date in Workday.Be provided a list of Consortium sites according to your zip code.Coordinate an appointment with the Consortium site.Complete physical inspection of unexpired, original items from the lists of acceptable documents with an Authorized Representative from the Consortium\n        Site. They will complete Part 2.Send color scans of the complete Form I-9 and the documents back to Onboard@Penn via SecureShare.Mail original Form I-9 and colored scans of documents used to: Onboard@Penn, 3601 Walnut Street, 2nd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19104.For additional assistance, please contact the Penn Employee Solution Center or call (215) 898-7372. An Onboard@Penn representative will provide guidance.The list of acceptable documents can be found here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if a new hire will not be on campus at any time to present documents?\n\n\n                            Please contact the Penn Employee Solution Center or call (215) 898-7372. An Onboard@Penn representative will provide guidance.\n                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do new hires need to bring physical documents to Onboard@Penn when they resume operations if they sent them virtually?\n\n\nSubmitting employment authorization documents virtually was a temporary stopgap option due to COVID-19. \nEmployers are still required by the Federal government to verify all new employees’ original documents physically, in person. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if the new employee is a foreign national who is unable to obtain a Social Security Number due to the Social Security Administration office's closures due to COVID-19? Can they still complete their I-9?\n\n\n\nForm I-9 can be completed without a Social Security Number. Information regarding the process of applying for a Social Security number can be found here on UPenn's ISSS website. \nPlease note that when new hires receive their Social Security card in the mail, they will need to bring the original card to Onboard@Penn to have their Social Security Number verified and updated in Workday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat documents are required for non-immigrant hires to complete Part 2 of Form I-9?\n\n\nThe list of acceptable documents can be found on the USCIS website.ALL DOCUMENTS NEED TO BE UNEXPIRED AND ORIGINAL. WE CANNOT ACCEPT SCANS, COPIES, OR ANY OTHER FORMAT.The following are examples of the original, unexpired documents that may be required in addition to documents presented for completion of Form I-9:PassportWork Authorization Document\n        I-20 for F-1 Visa (all pages)DS-2019 for J-1 VisaI-797 for H-1 VisaMost recent I-94 (printed from DHS website)Employment Authorization Card (if applicable)\n        Student on OPT or STEM-OPT extensionPending Permanent ResidencyJ-2 or M-1 work authorization status)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy hasn't a new hire's direct deposit information been processed if they already completed both Parts 1 and 2 of Form I-9?\n\n\nEmployees also need to complete all the onboarding tasks in their Workday inbox. Some items require clicking the orange \"submit\" button at the bottom of the screen. Once all these tasks are completed, both Parts of Form I-9,\r\n    direct deposit information will be processed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick Links\n\n\n\nLinks List\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkday@Penn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn HR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU@Penn\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPennCard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn Global\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         University of Pennsylvania    Onboard@Penn 3601 Walnut Street, 2nd Floor Philadelphia, PA 19104-3433 SolutionCenter@upenn.edu (215) 898-7372         Home                                             Penn Home          Penn HR Home          U@Penn             Copyright © 2023 The University of Pennsylvania    Copyright     Equal Opportunity Employer     Legal Notices     Clery Act     Report Accessibility Issues and Get Help             ",

For that, our research spans device, VLSI, design automation, computer architecture and related system support (OS/PL/VM), and algorithm. One key differentiator of our research is that besides modeling and simulations, we put strong emphasis on real hardware demonstration through architecting, designing and testing new prototypes, both at chip level and system level to validate our theory. In addition to hardware, we are also interested in bringing up ecosystems and developing key software instrastrucutre to support the new hardware. The systems that we built have achieved several key milestones. One of the highlights is ENIAD, a successor to ENIAC, which is ranked No. 1 on GreenGraph500 list and sets the world record performance in AI-enriched big data analytics (e.g., cognitive search - the next generation search engine). To further extend the system scaling roadmap beyond Moore’s law, we have taped out several new computer chips with complete system support (programming model, runtime, virtualization, API, etc.) that are built with post-CMOS nonvolatile memory technology (e.g., RRAM) integrated with silicon CMOS through monolithic 3D integration, including Liquid Silicon which won DARPA Young Faculty Award (one out of 2 in computer area and one out of 26 across all areas in science and technology nationwide), and Two-Dimensional Associative Processor (2D AP) which won NSF CAREER Award, in addition to the first fabricated in-memory processing chip for search, and a variable-bit storage chip which won IBM’s the highest technical achievement awards, the IBM’s CEO Milestone. More details about our research can be found at Research. A research vision on the importance of interaction between machine learning and computer system can be found at our white paper (co-authored with a number of experts in both machine learning and system fields). A research vision on future memory and storage can be found at our SRC-SIA Webinar Decadal Plan for Semiconductors: New Trajectories for Memory and Storage with Dr. Sean Eilert (Micron), Dr. Carolyn Duran (Intel), Dr. David Pellerin (Amazon), Dr. Steffen Hellmold (Twist Bioscience), Dr. Jesse Mee (Air Force Research Laboratory), moderated by Dr. Heike Riel (IBM).\nPennCIL is associated with the ESE department and the CIS department at the University of Pennsylvania. We were part of Computer Architecture group and Machine Learning group at UW-Madison.\nWe are also part of one of the six SRC JUMP centers - Center for Research on Intelligent Storage and Processing-In-Memory (CRISP).\nOur research also greatly benefits from our strong ties with the leading industry and successful technology transfer experience.

It requires modest system changes and has low deployment barrier but the performance gain might be potentially limited. 2) Rethinking computer systems with post-CMOS technology, a more aggressive approach in pushing innovations across the entire system stack. It could lead to dramatic improvement in performance but often requires more disruptive change in both hardware and software.\n\nAugmenting Computer Systems with Domain Specific Accelerators/Emerging Memories\nIn this research theme, we organize our research around three high-level questions: 1) How to design domain specific accelerators for big data and machine learning applications? 2) What kind of system abstractions are needed to convert hardware specialization into direct benefits that can actually be realized by end-applications and “everyday” programmers? 3) How to effectively evaluate these cross-stack system methods with high fidelity, fairness, and performance? In this research, we aim to answer these questions via the following three paths: 1) architecture/algorithm co-design, 2) mechanisms and abstractions for virtualization, and 3) open-source system research infrastructure.\nARCHITECTURE/ALGORITHM CO-DESIGN\nLarge Scale Graph Analytics\nExtremely large, sparse graphs with billions of nodes and hundreds of billions of edges arise in many important problem domains ranging from social science, bioinformatics, to video content analysis and search engines. In response to the increasingly larger and more diverse graphs, and the critical need of analyzing them, we focus on large scale graph analytics, an essential class of big data analysis, to explore the comprehensive relationship among a vast collection of interconnected entities. However, it is challenging for existing computer systems to process the massive-scale real-world graphs, not only due to their large memory footprint, but also that most graph algorithms entail irregular memory access patterns and a low compute-to-memory access ratio.\nIn this research, we invented “degree-aware” hardware/software techniques to improve graph processing efficiency. Our research is built atop a key insight that we obtained from architecture-independent algorithm analysis, which has not been revealed in prior work. More specifically, we identified that a key challenge in processing massive-scale graphs is the redundant graph computations caused by the presence of high-degree vertices which not only increase the total amount of computations but also incur unnecessary random data access. To address this challenge, we developed variants of graph processing systems on an FPGA-HMC platform [Zhang2018FPGA-Graph, Khoram2018FPGA, Zhang2017FPGA-BFS]. For the first time, we leverage the inherent graph property i.e. vertex degree to co-optimize algorithm and hardware architecture. In particular, the unique contributions we made include two algorithm optimization techniques: degree-aware adjacency list reordering and degree-aware vertex index sorting. The former reduces the number of redundant graph computations, while the latter creates a strong correlation between vertex index and data access frequency, which can be effectively applied to guide the hardware design. Further, by leveraging the strong correlation between vertex index and data access frequency created by degree-aware vertex index sorting, we developed two platform-dependent hardware optimization techniques, namely degree-aware data placement and degree-aware adjacency list compression. These two techniques together substantially reduce the amount of external memory access. Finally, we completed the full system design on an FPGA-HMC platform to verify the effectiveness of these techniques. Our implementation achieved the highest performance (45.8 billion traversed edges per second) among existing FPGA-based graph processing systems and was ranked No. 1 on GreenGraph500 list.\nWe have broken our previous record that we made at UW-madison in 2019 and created a new world record at Penn!\nGreen Graph500: New ENIAD ranking (updated June 30, 2021)\nGreen Graph500: Old ranking (updated June 19, 2019)\nMore news can be found at Penn Today, Penn Engineering Today and TCFPGA News.\nDeep Leaning and AI\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) deliver impressive results for a variety of challenging tasks in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing, at the cost of higher computational complexity and larger model size. To reduce the load of taxing DNN infrastructures, a number of FPGA-based DNN accelerators have been proposed via new micro-architectures, data ow optimizations, or algorithmic transformation. Due to the extremely large design space, it is challenging to attain good insights on how to design optimal accelerators on a target FPGA.\nIn this research, we take an alternative, and more principled approach to guide accelerator architecture design and optimization. We borrow the insights from the roofline model and further improve it by taking both on-chip and off-chip memory bandwidth into consideration. We apply the model to quantify the difference between available resources provided by native hardware (FPGA devices) and actual resources demanded by the application (CNN classification kernel). To tackle the problem, we develop a number of hardware/software techniques and implement them on FPGA [Zhang2017FPGA-CNN]. The demonstrated accelerator was recognized as the highest performance and the most energy efficient accelerator for dense convolutional neural network (CNN) compared to the state-of-the-art FPGA-based designs.\nMECHANISMS AND ABSTRACTIONS FOR VIRTUALIZATION IN CLOUD\nWhile traditionally being used in embedded systems, custom silicon (e.g., FPGAs) has recently begun to make their way into data centers and the cloud (Amazon AWS EC2 F1 instances, Microsoft Brainwave, Google TPU etc.). While these programmable data-flow architectures provide the lucrative benefits of fine-grained parallelism and high flexibility to accelerate a wide spectrum of applications, system support for them in the context of multi-tenant cloud environment, however, is in its infancy and has two major limitations, 1) inefficient resource management due to the tight coupling between compilation and runtime management, and 2) high programming complexity when exploiting scale-out acceleration, for which the root cause is that hardware resources are not virtualized.\nIn this research, we take FPGA as a case study and develop a full stack solution that can address these limitations and thus, enable virtualization of FPGA clusters in multi-tenant cloud computing environment. Specifically, the key contribution is a new system abstraction that can effectively decouple the compilation and runtime resource management. It allows applications to be compiled offline onto the proposed abstraction and resource allocation to be dynamically determined at runtime. Moreover, it creates an illusion of a single/large virtual FPGA to users, thereby reducing the programming complexity and supporting scale-out acceleration. It also provides virtualization support for the peripheral components (e.g. on-board DRAM, Ethernet), as well as protection and isolation support to ensure a secure execution in multi-tenant cloud environment [Zha2020ASPLOS].\nOPEN SOURCE COMPUTER SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE\nHardware-software co-design studies targeting next-generation computer systems that are equipped with emerging memories (HBM/HMC, NVM, etc.) are fundamentally hampered by a lack of scalable, performant and accurate simulation platform. Using software simulator is fundamentally bottlenecked by the low simulation speed and low fidelity, making it impractical to run realistic software stack. Such a challenge has limited effective cross-stack innovations (across computer architecture, OS, compiler, machine learning, and domain sciences). Past efforts have largely focused on simulation infrastructure for processor cores with highly simplified models of the memory subsystem. As a key contribution to the community (including SRC JUMP centers, broad academia and industry) to better drive cross-stack memory system research, we have been developing MEG [Zhang2019FCCM] – an open source FPGA- based simulation platform that enables cycle-exact micro-architecture simulation for computer systems with a special focus on memory subsystem (heterogeneous memory, near/in-memory acceleration). In MEG, we combine silicon- proven RTL design of RISC-V cores with configurable heterogeneous memory subsystems (HMC/HBM/NVM). It is capable of running realistic software stacks including booting Linux and comprehensive application software with high fidelity (cycle-exact microarchitectural models derived from synthesizable RTL), flexibility (modifiable to include custom RTL user IP and/or more abstract models), reproducibility, observability, target software support and performance. MEG can be an effective complement to previous RAMP and more recent Firesim projects in covering memory space and a contribution to the open source RISC-V community.\n\nRethinking Computer Systems with Post-CMOS Technology\nLooking forward, we believe more disruptive approaches are needed to fundamentally re-think about how we build computers to address von Neumann bottleneck. We envision future computer chips will not solely be made by Si but rather can utilize and optimize the best of various post-CMOS technologies (including but not limited to novel 1D/2D devices, spintronics, resistive switching devices, quantum electrical/optical device, etc.), to effectively complement silicon CMOS in providing auxiliary/ancillary functions (or cost benefits) that otherwise cannot be easily achieved with silicon CMOS. In this research, we take emerging nonvolatile memory technology (e.g., RRAM) as a case study to showcase two general-purpose in-memory computing architectures based on two radically different non-von Neumann machine models. Note that these two architectures are fundamentally different from prior rich literature of applying memory array as domain-specific dot-product computing unit.\nLiquid Silicon\nLiquid Silicon (L-Si) is a general-purpose in-memory computing architecture with complete system support that addresses several key fundamental limitations of state-of-the-art reconfigurable data-flow architectures (including FPGA, TPU, CGRA, etc.) in supporting emerging machine learning and big data applications. As compared with most projects in literature which focus on part of the system stack, L-Si is a full stack solution that comprises architecture [Zha2018FPGA], compiler [Zha2016ICCAD], programming model and system integration [Zha2018ASPLOS], with a real chip demonstration [Zha2019VLSIC]. The computing model of L-Si is radically different from state-of-the-art reconfigurable data-flow architectures. It maximally reuses the memory array itself (instead of placing computation units near the array) to perform a) heavy weight computation (logic), b) light weight computation(search), c) data storage (memory), and d) communication (routing), with minimal requirement in CMOS supporting circuitry, which can thus be further placed beneath the array. Therefore, it inherits the great benefits of semiconductor memory in integration density and cost, and offers orders of magnitude more parallel data processing capability in situ in the memory array than the best-known solution today. For the first time, it fundamentally blurs the boundary between computation and storage, by exploiting a continuum of general-purpose in-memory compute capabilities across the whole spectrum, from full memory to full computation, or intermediate states in between (partial memory and partial computation). Thus, it provides programmers (or compiler) more flexibility to customize hardware’s compute and memory resources to better match applications needs for higher performance and energy efficiency. We leverage such unique property and provide compiler support to facilitate the programming of applications written in high-level programming languages (e.g. OpenCL) and frameworks (e.g. TensorFlow, MapReduce) while fully exploiting the unique architectural capability of L-Si. We also provide scalable multi-context architectural support to minimize reconfiguration overhead for assisting virtualization when combined with our system stack.\nTimeline of L-Si project\nTo prove the feasibility of L-Si, we fabricated a test chip in 130 nm CMOS process with HfO2 RRAM – the first real-chip demonstration for general purpose in-memory computing using RRAM.\nDie Photo and Chip Characteristics of L-Si\nWith proposed system support, we evaluated a broad class of legacy and emerging machine learning workloads. Our measurement confirmed the chip operates reliably at low voltage of 650 mV when running these workloads. It achieves 60.9 TOPS/W in performing neural network inferences and 480 GOPS/W in performing high-dimensional similarity search (a key big data application) at nominal voltage supply of 1.2V, showing > 3x and ~100x power efficiency improvement over the state-of-the-art domain-specific CMOS-/RRAM-based accelerators without sacrificing the programmability. In addition, it outperforms the latest nonvolatile FPGA in energy efficiency by > 3x in general compute-intensive applications. As L-Si is a fundamental new computing technology, moving further, we will explore how to scale it up to warehouse computers and scale it down to IoT devices by further specializing the software/hardware stacks.\nComparing L-Si with State-of-the-Art\nTwo-Dimensional Associative Processor\nThe research project, titled “Associative In-Memory Graph Processing Paradigm: Towards Tera-TEPS Graph Traversal In a Box\", won the NSF CAREER Award in 2018. In this research, we developed a radically new computing paradigm, namely two-dimensional associative processing (2D AP) to further advance our previous FPGA-based graph processing architectures and fundamentally address their limitations. Mathematically, 2D AP is a new general-purpose computing model that exploits an extra dimension of parallelism (both intra-word and inter-word parallelism) to accelerate computation as compared with traditional AP which only exploit inter-word parallelism. It is particularly beneficial for massive-scale graph processing. For the first time, we provide a theoretical proof that 2D AP is inherently more efficient as measured by “architecturally determined complexity” in runtime/area/energy than both von Neumann architecture and traditional AP paradigm in performing graph computation. We also provide detailed micro-architectures and circuits to best implement the proposed computing model, with domain-special language support. A preliminary published version of 2D AP [Khoram2018CAL] was recognized as best of CAL (IEEE Computer Architecture Letters) in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProjects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquid Silicon\n\n\n      A general-purpose in-memory computing architecture that addresses several key fundamental limitations of state-of-the-art …\n    \n\n\nYue Zha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo Dimensional Associative Processor (2D AP)\n\n\n      A radically new computing paradigm to further advance FPGA-based graph processing architectures and fundamentally address their …\n    \n\n\nJing Li\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMEG\n\n\n      An open source FPGA-based simulation platform for computer systems\n    \n\n\nJialiang Zhang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtualization in Cloud\n\n\n      Virtualization of FPGA clusters in multi-tenant cloud computing environment\n    \n\n\nYue Zha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLarge Scale Graph Analytics\n\n\ndegree-aware hardware/software techniques to improve graph processing efficiency.\n    \n\n\nJialiang Zhang, Jing Li\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeep Learning and AI\n\n\n      An alternative, and more principled approach to guide accelerator architecture design and optimization\n    \n\n\nJialiang Zhang\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent Publications\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYue Zha, Jing Li\n\n  (2021).\n  When Application-Specific ISA Meets FPGAs: A Multi-LayerVirtualization Framework for Heterogeneous Cloud FPGAs.\n  the 25th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, ser.

The theater had been built in 1599 in William Shakespeare's company of players, the Lord Chamberlin's Men, and is associated with the playwright to this day.\n\r\nAt the Penn Libraries, you can learn about Shakespeare, his contemporaries, and the history of Shakespearean performance when you explore the collections of the The Horace Howard Furness Memorial Library.\r\n.\r\n#UPenn #PennLibraries #TodayInHistory #WilliamShakespeare #Shakespeare #GlobeTheater #RareBooks #LibrariesOfInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#OnThisDay in 1969, police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City’s Greenwich Village. Patrons resisted arrest, and for six days fought back against the police who threatened the bar. A year later, a coalition of advocacy groups commemorated the event with a demonstration now known as the first Pride Parade.\n\r\nTo help you celebrate Pride Month, staff, students, and faculty of Penn’s LGBT Center have put together a selection of books and films that explore the LGBTQ experience from a wide variety of perspectives. Here are some of their recommendations.\n\r\nKissing the Witch by Emma Donoghue\r\nGeorge by Alex Gino\r\nQueer: A Graphic History by Meg-John Barker and Julia Scheele\r\nUnder the Udala Trees by Chinelo Okparanta\r\nThe Handmaiden, directed by Chan-Wook Park\r\nMa Vie en Rose, directed by Alain Berliner\r\nThe Watermelon Woman, written and directed by Cheryl Dunye\r\n.\r\n#UPenn #PennLibraries #Libraries #LibraryLove #LibraryPride #LibrariesOfInstagram #TodayInHistory #Stonewall #PrideMonth #Pride2021\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"People were stupid, sometimes. They thought the Library was a dangerous place because of all the magical books, which was true enough, but what made it really one of the most dangerous places there could ever be was the simple fact that it was a library. \" —Terry Pratchett, Guards, Guards\r\n.\r\n#UPenn #PennLibraries #BeautifulLibraries #Shelfie #LibrariesOfInstagram #LibraryStacks #Bookstagram #GuardsGuards #TerryPratchett #GNUTerryPratchett\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople have worshipped, admired, and been awed by elephants for thousands of years. Illustrations of them appear in some of the oldest items in the Penn Libraries, including this one from a horoscope roll in our South Asian Studies collections. #WorldElephantDay \n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that @Penn students, faculty, and staff can borrow books from the Penn Libraries all summer long? Wherever you are, you can get library materials delivered to your door using Books By Mail.\n\nJust search the Franklin catalog and select Books By Mail at checkout. \n\n\n\n\n\nRT @whitneytrettien: A beautiful Romantic-era album at @upennlib has been digitized!

I am a professor in the Department of Mathematics, and an affiliated faculty member of the Applied Mathematics and Computational Science graduate program, at the University of Pennsylvania.  \n          \n\n              My research focuses on the mathematical analysis of non-linear partial differential equations which arise in physical contexts.  I have proven results on partial differential equations from diverse areas including fluid dynamics, kinetic theory, and materials science. I do research on problems involving local and global existence and uniqueness of solutions, large time sharp asymptotic behavior and convergence to equilibrium, finite time blow up, and ill-posedness of solutions. I tend to study physically motivated partial differential equations including the incompressibleÂ Navier-StokesÂ equations,Â the relativisticÂ EulerÂ system, theÂ MuskatÂ problem, theÂ BoltzmannÂ andÂ LandauÂ equation underÂ NewtonianÂ mechanicsÂ orÂ special-relativity and the Vlasov equations.\n            \nI currently serve on the Editorial Boards of the following journals:  Acta Applicandae Mathematicae (ACAP), Communications in Mathematical Analysis and Applications (CMAA), Communications on Pure and Applied Analysis (CPAA), and SIAM Journal on Mathematical Analysis (SIMA).\n\n\nContact Information\n                 Department of Mathematics\n                 University of Pennsylvania\n                 David Rittenhouse Lab\n                 209 South 33rd Street \n                 Philadelphia, PA 19104-6395 \n                   (215) 898-4828\n                 Office: DRL 3E5\n                 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn Library VPN Proxy Links\n\nPenn's Library via Proxy\nMathSciNet via Proxy\nMathSciNet\nZentralblatt via Proxy\nZentralblatt\n\n\n\nPenn Mathematics Seminars\n\nEvents\nCalendar\nPDE\nColloquium\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Students in the program can expect to complete two degrees in four years, a BA in a life sciences major through the College of Arts & Sciences, and a BSE in management through the Wharton business school. A watchword of the program is learning by doing. Students learn to apply and integrate the knowledge and skills they gain through direct practical experience both within and beyond the classroom. This they do by joining a supportive community of students, alumni and senior professionals all of whom are interested and invested in the transformative potential of the biosciences when implemented shrewdly.

It is an interdisciplinary program, created through a collaboration of the Departments of Anthropology, History and Sociology of Science/Health & Societies, Philosophy, Political Science, and Sociology in the College of Arts and Sciences, and Medical Ethics & Health Policy in the Perelman Medical School.  The minor consists only of selected courses from these six departments.\nStudents of any major are eligible for the bioethics minor.  If interested in the minor and in joining the listserv, contact Dr. Sinderbrand or Dr. Martucci.\n \n\n \n\n\n\nContact\nDr. Molly SinderbrandDirector Department of Medical Ethicsmolly.sinderbrand@pennmedicine.upenn.eduDr. Jessica MartucciFaculty Advisor in The Collegejmartucc@sas.upenn.edu\nArnold (AJ) RoholtContact for Course Permissionsarroholt@pennmedicine.upenn.edu\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPenn WebLogin\n \n\n\n© 2023 The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\n\n \n\n",
